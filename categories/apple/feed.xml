I use the excellent utility &lt;a class="link" href="https://apps.apple.com/gb/app/dato/id1470584107?mt=12" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>Dato&lt;/a> on my MacBook to ensure I don&amp;rsquo;t miss any meetings, but this afternoon I noticed a meeting in my Outlook calendar that wasn&amp;rsquo;t appearing in Dato.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>At first I assumed this was a repeat of an occasional issue I have run into where my Exchange calendar just decides to stop syncing with my Calendar so I went through the normal &amp;ldquo;fix&amp;rdquo; of removing my Exchange account from Settings/Accounts and re-adding it. The trouble is this didn&amp;rsquo;t fix the issue, the missing appointment was still missing.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The difference with this appointment though was that it was booked into my calendar using the Microsoft Bookings app. This it seems is the issue. After a bunch of digging I came across &lt;a class="link" href="https://feedbackportal.microsoft.com/feedback/idea/e085dfaf-d5f4-ed11-a81c-000d3a7a48db" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>this entry on Microsoft Feedback&lt;/a> which explains that the issue is with Bookings entries not syncing correct with EWS (Exchange Web Services) which is the older mechanism for calendar sync still used by macOS. Apparently this issue only affects macOS and not iOS (the missing entry appears correctly in the Calendar app on my iPhone)&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I have added my vote on Microsoft Feedback for this to be resolved for what its worth, though I do wonder if the better solution would be for Apple to upgrade Calendar sync in macOS to use Exchange ActiveSync (EAS) which works correctly on iOS ?&lt;/p>

&lt;p>After much deliberation I finally ordered a new M3 MacBook Air from Amazon last week after I spotted a &lt;a class="link" href="https://amzn.to/49qxNcA" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>16Gb/512Gb version going for Â£100 off list price&lt;/a>. I am not sure why this model was available as Amazon typically only have the 8Gb versions available. There was only one colour available, Starlight, but for the reduction in price I decided I could live with something other than Space Grey for a change.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I was given Tuesday 26th as the delivery date but after waiting all day for a delivery up to 10pm the status of my order was changed to &amp;ldquo;We will email you when we have a delivery date&amp;rdquo;. This was more than a little disappointing. I waited a couple of days before contacting Amazon for an update and after a brief call I was told it would be with me this week but no precise date was given. I was surprised then to get an update on Friday morning to say it had been despatched and would be with me by 7pm, it arrived safely around 5pm.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I have been a happy owner of a 16&amp;quot; M1 MacBook Pro (which I upgraded to from an original M1 MacBook Air with 8Gb) for the last couple of years and really didn&amp;rsquo;t &lt;strong>need&lt;/strong> an upgrade but I longed for something a little more portable than the 16&amp;quot; which is a wonderful powerful laptop but not exactly featherweight. Practically I am hopeful that the M3 Air will deliver similar performance to my Pro in a much more lightweight package, especially as my workload doesn&amp;rsquo;t involve a lot of processor heavy applications. I am also hoping that the second hand re-sale value of the MacBook Pro will pretty much cover the cost of the brand new Air.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I have had a couple of days with the new Air now and have mostly got things setup how I like them again and as expected it really feels no different to the Pro apart from when I pick it up from the desk to take it to another room. I don&amp;rsquo;t travel too much these days so carrying any distance is not a big issue but sitting with it on my lap feels so much more comfortable than the the 16&amp;quot; Pro.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>One of the other things I have been changing in the last month is my &lt;a class="link" href="https://obsidian.md" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>Obsidian&lt;/a> setup. Obsidian is an application that I have been trying to use for a long time but one of the main things that prevented my adoption was the fact that I wanted to be able to sync across Windows, macOS and iOS. Of course the simple answer to this would have been to subscribe to the &lt;a class="link" href="https://obsidian.md/sync" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>Obsidian Sync service&lt;/a> but I was loathe to start another subscription especially as I had yet to fully develop an essential workflow that relied on Obsidian.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Its fair to say that I am one of those types who prefer the configuration and setup of systems to actually using them and have tried and failed to make every type of note taking system and tool work for me. Having said that I have watched endless videos on note taking tools and Obsidian is the one that I have always thought &lt;strong>should&lt;/strong> be able to serve my needs well.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Prior to this month I had been using the &lt;a class="link" href="https://github.com/denolehov/obsidian-git" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>Obsidian Git plugin&lt;/a> with a reasonable amount of success, but have had numerous instances of sync issues caused by opening my vault on my MacBook and iPhone or iPad when there were uncommitted changes which then required command line tinkering to rollback changes. This sort of irritation is a big negative factor in adopting a smooth workflow as you will appreciate, so last month I finally submitted to another subscription and signed up to the entry level $4 a month plan.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The impact was immediate. Sync now just works including plugin installations and configuration settings which didn&amp;rsquo;t sync at all with my Git based solution which meant I was constantly making changes to multiple devices to keep plugin settings synchronised.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I am very happy with this setup at the moment and will continue with it for a few months on the monthly plan and if it looks like becoming a permenant part of my toolbox I will sign up for the annual plan to save a few quid. If you havent tried it yet and have been testing across multiple devices with Git or iCloud sync then I would definitely recommend setting up a monthly Obsidian Sync
subscription for a month or two to test it out.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Home Office Update</title><link>https://ukmac.net/p/home-office-update/</link><pubDate>Wed, 01 Nov 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ukmac.net/p/home-office-update/</guid><description>&lt;img src="https://ukmac.net/p/home-office-update/office1.jpg" alt="Featured image of post Home Office Update" />&lt;p>Finished sorting my office today and am really happy with how it looks now.

&lt;p>I have included a link to my standing desk frame below. I procrastinated over getting a standing desk for months and now I have one I wish I hadn&amp;rsquo;t. I find that I spend at least half my working day standing now and feel much better for it. If you are sitting on the fence (or your desk chair) debating if you should move to a standing desk I would definitely recommend doing it. If you can re-use your existing desktop as I did the cost is pretty reasonable (this one was aroound Â£170). Do it, your back will thank you later.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>First longish run for a long time this morning. Dropped Vel&amp;rsquo;s car at the garage for a service then run home. Felt pretty slow but looking at the total time and distance it actually wasn&amp;rsquo;t too bad. I enjoy running when I am doing it regularly and I can get to a decent pace without feeling like my lungs are going to burst but to get to that usually means a prolonged period of regular runs and at the moment I am not getting out often enough. Oddly running is something I tend to find I do more of in the winter, I find running in the hot weather uncomfortable and would much rather be cycling through the lanes for exercise in the Summer. The big benefit of running though is that 30-45 mins gets me the same benefit as a much longer day in the saddle so fitting into the family life schedule is generally easier.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>As predicted the Halloween Apple Event happened last night was all about the M3 processor laucnch in new versions of the MacBook Pro. The M3 is another incremental improvement over the previous generations Apple Silicon so it was interesting that most of the performance comparisons that Apple made during the event were between the M1 and M3 processors rather than between M2 and M3.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I suppose the point of making this comparison is to encourage early Apple Silicon adopters who are on M1 machines to upgrade even though for most users those M1 based Macs are still going to be fine for almost all uses. This is also why the event repeatedly referred to high end/power users. Its very clear the M3 Pro MacBooks are targetted to heavy users (video, simulation, audio production etc). This will be a challenge for Apple moving forward. Whilst two year iPhone upgrades cycles are commonplace for many users MacBooks and Macs tend to be on longer upgrade cycles and the new Apple Silicon Macs are SO fast and powerful this cycle will potentially be able to stretch even longer. I know for me the ugrade of my current M1 MacBook Pro is likely to be some time away.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>This morning started with a quick ride on stage 5 of Tour of Watopia (Canopies and Coastlines). This route started with the Titans Grove KOM reverse before taking in the new Watopia coastal road and finally ending at Sasquatch Sprint all in just over 28km and about 245m of climbing. A nice route made nicer by having the garage door open to let some Autumn sunshine in.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Ride out of the way and onto chores, hopefully the last grass cut of the year followed by cleaning the roof panels from the gazebo ready to be stored away for the winter. Later in the afternoon when the clouds opened with a torrential downpour I was pretty glad I chose the morning to get these jobs sorted.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>I hadn&amp;rsquo;t heard from Will or spoken to him in some time but the out of the blue call from James did leave me winded. James and I spoke for quite a while, reminiscing about things and I think both of us could not quite believe it. Our friendship came about through our love of Apple Mac computers and a strange coincidence of geography.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>My interest in Macs started when I bought an 17&amp;quot; G5 iMac in 2005. At the time my work life was entirely Windows centric and I think I recall deciding to buy a Mac mostly out of curiosity. I was of course quickly sold by the elegance, slick design and polished software.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>I think soon after I bought into the Mac lifestyle I registered this domain (ukmac.net) and started with my early blog focused on Apple and my new Mac. As a keen Apple fan I of course started consuming what I could from the Internet from various web sites/blogs and also from a number of podcasts such as Macbreak Weekly and the wildly eccentric BritishMac podcast.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>BritishMac was a regular chart topper in the podcast Tech charts in those days and by a bizarre twist of fate was run by Will who happened to live only a few miles from me in Ironbridge, Shropshire. Through another weird coincidence I came into contact with James who had also recently started a Mac focused blog at Ukmac.co.uk, even more coincidently James lived in Broseley a few miles away from Ironbridge in the opposite direction from myself. It was meant to be I guess.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Suffice to say James, Will and myself ended up meeting in Ironbridge for a few beers and to talk about our favourite subject, Macs.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Will was one of life&amp;rsquo;s characters. If you ever heard any of his podcast episodes you will know what I mean. His blog and podcast were unique and eccentric, there really weren&amp;rsquo;t any like it at the time (nor since that I have seen at least). In addition to his irregular podcast postings Will used to host a Christmas get together in Ironbridge and would invite any of his listeners who wished to meet up for drinks and a curry at his local Indian restaurant, the Aftab.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>On a couple of these meet-ups Will got us together at a little studio he had at the time to record a podcast episode before we headed to town for food. The resulting recordings were somewhat less than polished but that wasn&amp;rsquo;t the point and didn&amp;rsquo;t stop everyone enjoying being part of the process.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Will&amp;rsquo;s funeral was this Tuesday in Shrewsbury and I was fully intending to go to show my respects and also to meet-up with some of the group that used to go to Will&amp;rsquo;s Christmas events but in a cruel twist I have been laid up in bed all week with a viral illness and was not able to make it.&lt;/p>

Trouble is they were paired to my MacBook so didnât show up in Bluetooth settings on the iPad to pair them and I couldnât remember how to reset them.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The solution for this was quite easy. Just power each device on and off five times, then go to the Bluetooth settings on the iPad and they appear ready for pairing.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Managing Trackpad on MacOS when using external mouse</title><link>https://ukmac.net/p/managing-trackpad-on-macos-when-using-external-mouse/</link><pubDate>Mon, 06 Mar 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ukmac.net/p/managing-trackpad-on-macos-when-using-external-mouse/</guid><description>&lt;p>Following my desk space re-organisation this weekend I am back to using my MacBook keyboard again for the first time in quite a while. Having worked predominantly with an external mouse and keyboard with my MacBook in clamshell mode in a vertical stand I decided I would like to disable the MacBook trackpad.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Simple you would think? Apple do kindly offer a setting in the Mouse &amp;amp; Trackpad Accessibility preferences to do this very thing, however after switching on the option I found my trackpad was still fully operation even with my Logitech MX Master connected. It appears that Bluetooth mice don&amp;rsquo;t register as a mouse being present?&lt;/p>

>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The fix I discovered was to use another Accessibility preference known as Mouse Keys, a legacy service designed to allow cursor control using the keyboard.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Firstly enable Mouse Keys by switching on the slider in the Pointer Control options, then click on the i next to the slider to reveal the additional preferences dialog below.&lt;/p>

>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Switch on the two sliders to disable the trackpad when Mouse Keys is on and also enable the option to quickly enable/disable Mouse Keys by pressing the Option key 5 times. You should find that the trackpad is now correctly disabled. To enable the trackpad again just turn off Mouse Keys by tapping Option key 5 times.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Job done.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>macOS Monterey QuickLook still flaky</title><link>https://ukmac.net/p/macos-monterey-quicklook-still-flaky/</link><pubDate>Fri, 02 Sep 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ukmac.net/p/macos-monterey-quicklook-still-flaky/</guid><description>&lt;img src="https://ukmac.net/p/macos-monterey-quicklook-still-flaky/monterey.jpg" alt="Featured image of post macOS Monterey QuickLook still flaky" />&lt;p>We are probably only a month or so away from the release of the latest macOS version &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.apple.com/uk/macos/macos-ventura-preview/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"

&lt;p>Pretty regularly I will press Space on a file in the Finder to get a quick preview only to be greeted with a thumbnail image of the file. This has been a problem for me (and others) for some time now and whilst there is a quick fix (Force Quit the Finder) it really shouldn&amp;rsquo;t be necessary after five major updates to the operating system should it ?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>To be honest I am not sure if it is something specific to some of the software I use but I have seen it now on two MacBooks (my previous M1 MacBook Air and my current M1 MacBook Pro) and I have found lots of references to others with the same issue so it does seem to be a pretty widespread issue.&lt;/p>

>Working Copy&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>A few weeks ago I happened across a previously owned Apple Magic Keyboard for iPad 12.9&amp;quot; on Amazon at a big discount. I have tried to justify Â£350 for a keyboard since I bought the 12.9&amp;quot; iPad Pro but just couldn&amp;rsquo;t find a compelling enough reason but when I saw this one I figured I would take a punt and if it was no good I could always return it. Well that was a while back now and I am still a happy Magic Keyboard owner. It really does make the iPad Pro into a powerhouse portable device. The keyboard is great and the trackpad works as you would expect from an Apple device, smooth and slick.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I am pretty much only using the iPad when not at my desk now, even though I also have the amazing M1 MacBook Air ( lucky me eh ? ) and now Obsidian is out on iPad I have decided to try to use it on the iPad for updating this blog. To do this does require something to sync to GitHub and this is where WorkingCopy comes in.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Working Copy is a full git client for iOS and at Â£17.99 is not a cheap app but it seems to be the only real option for this sort of workflow and is an established solution so if you have a need for git on iPad its a bit of a no-brainer.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Anyway, this is my first post using this setup and it worked first time which is great. Maybe I will finally start posting here a bit more ( how many times have I written that ? )&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Daily Post - 2/7/2021</title><link>https://ukmac.net/p/daily-post-2/7/2021/</link><pubDate>Fri, 02 Jul 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ukmac.net/p/daily-post-2/7/2021/</guid><description>&lt;p>One of the things I lost the ability to do as I got older is concentrating/working while listening to certain types of music.

&lt;p>New MacBook Air ( M1 Edition ) arrived this afternoon and just wow&amp;hellip;. I am so glad I was tempted by the Amazon Black Friday Â£100 off and 5 months interest free credit deal now. Before I saw the Amazon deal I had been toing and froing for a few weeks since the new M1 Macs were launched.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Now I am setting it up and synching photos etc and after an hour and a half on my lap its not even warm ! Amazing stuff.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Of course its hard to say anything that hasn&amp;rsquo;t already been said far more eloquently that I can. Universal acclaim has been laid on these new Macs from all corners of the Internet and it really does seem like a new standard has been set, it just remains to be seen if anyone is capable of meeting the challenge of creating machines that come anything close to what Apple have done with their new Macs.&lt;/p>

My Mac computing needs have been handled by a 2018 Mac Mini which is a super little machine, quiet, powerful enough for my needs and very unobtrusive. I have still been hankering after a new MacBook though but the promise of new Apple Silicon based hardware has kept me from shelling out. I fully expected to not be able to resist buying when the announcement happened last week and have to admit I have been close to pressing the buy button a couple of times but have so far not succumbed.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>On the one hand I think I am waiting to see what the early reviews have to say, though I think its pretty clear they are going to be all good. On the other I do wonder about the version 1 product and whether I should perhaps wait until release 2 and see what that has to offer ? I guess for now I will wait and see, though I am pretty certain that if money was no object I would already have dropped the cash and would be patiently waiting for the delivery right now&amp;hellip;&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>New AirPods Pro noise cancellation</title><link>https://ukmac.net/p/new-airpods-pro-noise-cancellation/</link><pubDate>Thu, 31 Oct 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ukmac.net/p/new-airpods-pro-noise-cancellation/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;a class="link" href="https://twitter.com/ryan/status/1189643522418151424" target="_blank" rel="noopener"

&lt;a class="link" href="https://bombich.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>Carbon Copy Cloner&lt;/a> image of my main drive ) and then do a clean install ( erase the entire drive and install from scratch ). Obviously this takes a little more time and effort than a normalÂ upgrade but I tend to prefer knowing that any legacy cruft built up over the life of the previous version is washed away.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>When
&lt;a class="link" href="http://www.apple.com/uk/osx/?cid=wwa-uk-kwg-mac" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>El Capitan&lt;/a> was released last year I decided not to bother with a clean install on my MacBook and ran an upgrade and everything has worked fine since then until the last week or so. Firstly disk space has been getting low on my 256GB drive which is never great but then I started to experience a problem with the App Store taking a long time to load which deteriorated to the point where no matter how long I left it running the content in the main panes failed to materialise at all. As I wanted to load a particular new app this was a bit of a problem to say the least. I looked for solutions to the issue without much success ( admittedly I didn&amp;rsquo;t look that hard ) before deciding to do a re-install to freshen up my OS.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Roll forward a couple of hours and I have a clean install of
&lt;a class="link" href="http://www.apple.com/uk/osx/?cid=wwa-uk-kwg-mac" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>El Capitan&lt;/a>, my essential data restored from backup, apps reinstalled and App Store fully working. I also now have 140GB of my 256GB drive still free which shows how much disk space can get swallowed up by working files and general detritus in the course of a year. Granted there are a few things I have chosen not to restore but nothing that would account for 100GB of disk space.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Anyway, all this brings me to the point of this article which is how to enable three finger drag of windows in
&lt;a class="link" href="http://www.apple.com/uk/osx/?cid=wwa-uk-kwg-mac" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>El Capitan&lt;/a> ! When the re-install had finished one of the first things I did was to go to System Preferences to sort out my Trackpad settings. By default my three main tweaks to the standard configuration are to switch off natural scrolling ( I know old habits die hard ), switch on tap to click and finally switch on the option to drag windows with three finger gesture.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This time around the first two options were setup as normal but when I looked for the three finger drag option it seemed to have been moved. I was sure it used to be on the Scroll and Zoom section of the preference pane, or was it under More Gestures ? Nope, not there&amp;hellip; I must admit I looked for an embarrassingly long time going from one tab to the next in the vain hope that somehow I would see it where I hadn&amp;rsquo;t before, but it was gone&amp;hellip;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Thankfully it only took a minutes Googling to uncover the answer to the missing setting, Apple in their infinite wisdom have decided in
&lt;a class="link" href="http://www.apple.com/uk/osx/?cid=wwa-uk-kwg-mac" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>El Capitan&lt;/a> that this is not a Trackpad setting now but an Accessibility option ! To find the setting now first go to Accessibility in System Preferences, click on Â 
&lt;strong>Trackpad Options&lt;/strong>
and on the popup window tick to
&lt;strong>Enable dragging&lt;/strong>
Â and select
&lt;strong>three finger drag&lt;/strong>
from the drop down menu.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Of course the other thing I
&lt;strong>should have done&lt;/strong>
was to just type &amp;ldquo;three finger drag&amp;rdquo; into the search field in System Preferences which would have instantly told me I was looking in the wrong place !&lt;/p>

&lt;a class="link" href="https://smilesoftware.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>Smile Software&lt;/a> decision to move to a subscription model for version 6 of
&lt;a class="link" href="https://textexpander.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>TextExpander&lt;/a>, their popular text snippet app for OS X and iOS. Most of the words have understandably been pretty negative with users feeling that the change is purely a money grab by Smile. Obviously the economics of making a niche product like
&lt;a class="link" href="https://textexpander.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>TextExpander&lt;/a> pay its way are not simple and I really don&amp;rsquo;t know if the change was actually an unavoidable option, but regardless of the reasons behind the decision it is fairly clear that a fair number of Smiles previous customers will be thinking twice about the upgrade and looking at alternative options.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>There are a few alternatives to
&lt;a class="link" href="https://textexpander.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>TextExpander&lt;/a> and one of the main ones,
&lt;a class="link" href="http://www.ergonis.com/products/typinator/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>Typinator&lt;/a> from
&lt;a class="link" href="http://www.ergonis.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>Ergonis&lt;/a> are
&lt;a class="link" href="https://store.ergonis.com/products/typinator/?cp=TE1604W" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>offering a discount&lt;/a> to existing TextExpander users to move to their product during April.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The app is normally EUR 24.99 for a single user or EUR 37.99 for a family pack so the reduction makes it EUR 18.75 and EUR 28.50 respectively. To access the offer
&lt;a class="link" href="https://store.ergonis.com/products/typinator/?cp=TE1604W" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>go to this link&lt;/a> before the end of the month.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>If you are not happy spending this much on an alternative then a cheaper option is
&lt;a class="link" href="http://www.trankynam.com/atext/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>aText&lt;/a> at just $4.99.###UPDATE:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So it seems that the reasoning that Smile have given for the decision is based on the sharing features added in the updated version of TextExpander. They state
&lt;a class="link" href="https://smilesoftware.com/blog/entry/textexpander-release-follow-up" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>on this page&lt;/a> that the iCloud/Dropbox services would not allow them to implement the Group Sharing features that are the key new element of TextExpander.&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>Group sharing in the new TextExpander is quite different than syncing via Dropbox or iCloud. Sharing, as it stands, couldnât work using either sync service.&lt;/p>

>Copied&lt;/a> has recently become one of my favourite apps for iOS and OS X. It is a slick and useful clipboard manager that makes cut/copy and paste on iPhone,iPad and Mac much more useful and when combined with multiple devices introduces a new capability that was previously only possible by emailing or Messaging between devices. That feature is the ability to copy something on one device then jump over to another and paste that data on another device !&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The &lt;a class="link" href="https://geo.itunes.apple.com/gb/app/copied-copy-paste-everywhere/id1015767349?mt=8&amp;amp;at=1000lbQg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>iOS version&lt;/a> has a free to use version that allows you to save up to 10 entries into the clipboard and to recall any of these to paste into another app. The entries can be free text, images and links and importantly can be edited after being captured into the clipboard.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="in-use-on-ios">In Use on iOS&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Pasting an existing entry from the clipboard can be done in a number of ways. Firstly you can load the app and scroll through the list of entries to find the one you want. Once located tap on the entry and it opens in an editor where ( if the entry is text ) you can edit the contents of the clipboard if required. From here you also have a standard iOS Share button which allows you to send the entry to a suitable app as a new item ( document/tweet/Message etc ).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Alternatively you can click on the three dots icon to either copy the entry into the current clipboard ( so you can paste it into another app/document ), Share using a template or Transform the text if applicable. Transforming text gives options to convert to upper/lower/title case, removing whitespace etc.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="copied-keyboard">Copied Keyboard&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>The other method for accessing clipboard entries is through the Copied keyboard. This is accessed in the same way as other third party iOS keyboards by tapping the globe key on the standard keyboard to cycle through any additional keyboards you have installed. The keyboard replaces the normal keys with a grid of clipboard entries which you can scroll through ( sideways ) to find the entry you wish to paste into your document or text. Just tap the entry to paste the data at the cursor. Simple.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="copied">Copied+&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>For a small in-app purchase ( Â£1.49 in UK ) the basic free version can be upgraded to Copied+ which increases the clipboard size to 1,000 items and also includes the ability to organise clippings into Lists for better organisation. For example I have is a list of clippings for my address, mobile phone number etc which I can then use to quickly enter these into web forms.
&lt;a class="link" href="https://geo.itunes.apple.com/gb/app/copied-copy-paste-everywhere/id1015767349?mt=8&amp;amp;at=1000lbQg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>Copied+&lt;/a> also enables iCloud sync of the clipboard between devices as mentioned at the beginning of this review.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="copied-for-mac">Copied for Mac&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>The synchronisation doesn&amp;rsquo;t end with iOS though, when used in conjunction with the OS X version of the app data can be easily transferred between Mac and iPhone/iPad in just the same way. This is an incredibly useful feature and one that would really fit into the core operating system on these devices if Apple ever saw fit to develop this, however for now
&lt;a class="link" href="https://geo.itunes.apple.com/gb/app/copied-copy-paste-everywhere/id1015767349?mt=8&amp;amp;at=1000lbQg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>Copied&lt;/a> fills this space very nicely. It should be said that the OS X version of the app is Â£5.99 which isn&amp;rsquo;t free and there are other apps that provide similar features, but in my experience using Copied is a smooth and effective way of improving the way in which I can transfer data between apps on my iPhone and also between iPhone and Mac and I believe the overall benefit is worth the small outlay.&lt;/p>

>Near Lock&lt;/a> is a new pair of apps for iOS and OS X that allows you to unlock your Mac with your iPhone or Apple Watch. Once installed and configured the app can be configured to lock or unlock your Mac as soon as it detects the presence of your iPhone. The sensitivity of the detection can be adjusted from as little as 1m to as much as 10m so you can optimise the point at which it locks or unlocks your Mac according to your requirements.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The app works with recent iPhones and Macs that support Bluetooth LE and as a result can be left switched on all the time without it causing a significant drain on iPhone batteries. Furthermore the currently free in app upgrade to the Pro version on iOS allows the app to work even when in the background so there is no need to unlock your iPhone or run an app to unlock your Mac. If you are worried that just being able to walk up to your Mac with your iPhone is a little insecure ( think someone gets your phone and can unlock and access your Mac ) then the iOS app can be setup to require Touch ID authentication before it will unlock which is a nice but still convenient way of accessing your Mac.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Wonderful stuff&amp;hellip; Get it now while it is free !&lt;/p>

>2 Cars from Ketchapp&lt;/a>. It is a very simple top to bottom scroller where the objective is to steer your &lt;strong>2 Cars&lt;/strong> around the oncoming square blocks whilst at the same time intercepting the round blocks. Any collision with a square block ends the game. Any round block missed also ends the game. Each car can drive in one of two lanes and the only control is to tap the screen on the right to move the right hand car to the alternate lane and the screen on the left to move the left hand car.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Sounds simple doesn&amp;rsquo;t it ? Well give it a try and see how far you get, I can pretty much guarantee it will take you quite a few goes before you progress to double digit scores and after that progression is likely to be slow as the speed of the oncoming blocks increases pretty quickly once you get into the 40-50 score bracket.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>My wife has an iPhone 6 that was working fine until it suddenly stopped being able to open hyperlinks in Safari and Messages&amp;hellip; Oddly when searching in Safari with the browser set to use
&lt;strong>&lt;a class="link" href="https://www.google.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>Google&lt;/a>&lt;/strong>
as the default browser none of the returned links worked when tapping on them. The links simply refused to load. Changing the search engine to

the returned result links worked fine !&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Further testing with web links sent to Messages had the same result and worse, when I tried long pressing the link to bring up the menu to Copy the link the app ( Safari or Messages ) seemed to hang requiring it to be force quit. My initial search for solutions to this problem were unsuccessful as most of the returned links referred to similar issues reported a couple of years ago in previous iOS releases, so I

&lt;a class="link" href="http://themacfixer.co.uk" target="_blank" rel="noopener"

Reset All Settings which didn&amp;rsquo;t resolve the issue, followed by the more drastic
Erase All ContentÂ And Settings which did the trick !&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Obviously if you are affected by this issue and decide to do a complete Erase make sure you have all your settings and passwords available beforehand as you will need to setup accounts and applications from scratch afterwards ( don&amp;rsquo;t try restoring old backups because you will most likely just restore the problem ).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Hopefully not too many others are affected by this glitch and Apple get it sorted in the next update&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Rumour - Ultra-thin 13" and 15" MacBooks due in June-July</title><link>https://ukmac.net/p/rumour-ultra-thin-13-and-15-macbooks-due-in-june-july/</link><pubDate>Sat, 26 Mar 2016 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ukmac.net/p/rumour-ultra-thin-13-and-15-macbooks-due-in-june-july/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;a class="link" href="http://www.macrumors.com/2016/03/22/new-ultra-thin-13-15-macbooks-june-july/?utm_source=feedly&amp;amp;utm_medium=webfeeds" target="_blank" rel="noopener"

&lt;a class="link" href="http://eu.minidrive.bynifty.com/#" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>Nifty MiniDrive&lt;/a> a neat little MicroSD card carrier that fits completely snuggly into the SD slot on MacBooks adding disk space for photos/documents and other temporary files. They are relatively cheap and can be used with whatever size of MicroSD card you have available. The downside is that the disk space provided is a separate volume to the internal drive and as such you have to manage which files and folders go where. It is certainly a neater solution than plugging a USB drive into your MacBook but if the internal drive is struggling for space it doesn&amp;rsquo;t immediately solve that issue.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Then last night I came across a product called
&lt;a class="link" href="http://tardisk.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>TarDisk Pear&lt;/a> which uses the same idea of plugging extra storage into the SD card slot in a completely flush carrier but extends it to the next level. With the TarDisk Pear instead of the extra disk space being presented as an external removable volume the additional storage is magically used to extend the space available to the internal drive ! The web site doesn&amp;rsquo;t give many details on exactly how it does this but there are a few hints on the FAQ&amp;rsquo;s page where it talks about the risk of data corruption and loss if you remove the drive after it has been setup. Clearly the magic comes at a price.&lt;/p>

alt="TarDisk_Pear_2.0"
>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Despite looking I couldn&amp;rsquo;t find any information about the impact on the performance of the built in drive either. I would hope that it manages the data in a way that optimises the performance of the internal drive but this isn&amp;rsquo;t clear from what I have seen.&lt;/p>

Adding cards is very quick, just search for the store name from the extensive list then scan the card bar code using the iPhone camera and the cards details are captured. Now you can present the bar code on your iPhone to the cashier when making a purchase and they can scan this instead of the plastic. The app can also store card details for shops/companies not listed including adding a photo of the card for easy reference. I have used it to import my library cards for example.&lt;/p>

>Stocard&lt;/a> do acknowledge that some older scanners aren&amp;rsquo;t able to read the iPhone screen but in these cases the bar code can be entered manually by the cashier.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The app is available for iOS and Android and is a free download.&lt;/p>

>Duet Display&lt;/a> is a slick app developed by ex-Apple employees designed to allow your iPad to function as a second monitor on your laptop or iMac using a lightning or iPad 30 pin cable ( for older iPads ). The application works extremely well with none of the lag or latency in display refresh experienced by some of the alternative apps that use the iPads WiFi connection to transfer screen updates.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>As the Duet name suggests the intended use for the app is to create an easy to use portable secondary display for MacBook users ( or in fact Windows laptop users as there is a Windows version of the server application as well as one for OS X ) but it isn&amp;rsquo;t limited to this use case. My main use of Duet is as a primary monitor on my Mac Mini media server.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I have used my Mac Mini in a headless ( no monitor ) setup for a long time and use Screen Sharing from my MacBook to login and manage it, however it recently struck me that the
&lt;a class="link" href="https://geo.itunes.apple.com/gb/app/duet-display/id935754064?mt=8&amp;amp;at=1000lbQg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>Duet Display app&lt;/a>that I had purchased some time ago would be perfect for creating a tiny compact keyboard/monitor setup. Combined with a small bluetooth keyboard from Anker and bluetooth mouse I now have full access to my Mini in a compact little setup that looks pretty slick on the shelf in my study.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Duet Display is Â£7.99 in the UK iOS App store which I admit is probably at the high side of many peoples acceptable budget for an app of this type, however this app is extremely good and provides amazing functionally and performance. For people who travel with a MacBook and iPad the benefit of being able to setup a usable dual monitor setup whilst on the move can be liberating, and for home media servers like mine it can create a slick, compact and usable alternative to a bulky VGA/HDMI monitor.&lt;/p>

Clearly Apple held this back for good reason when the new device launched a few weeks ago but thankfully they have plugged the gap today with a new tvOS update that allows you to search for music by Siri.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The new update also fixes the other glaring omission of the iPhone Remote App not working with the new Apple TV.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Amazon Removes Apple TV From Store</title><link>https://ukmac.net/p/amazon-removes-apple-tv-from-store/</link><pubDate>Fri, 30 Oct 2015 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ukmac.net/p/amazon-removes-apple-tv-from-store/</guid><description>&lt;p>It seems that Amazon was serious with recent threats to pull ads for media streaming devices that don&amp;rsquo;t support their own &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Instant-Video/b/ref=nav_shopall_aiv?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;node=3010085031" target="_blank" rel="noopener"

&lt;p>It seems somewhat coincidental that this should happen on the first day that the new Apple TV is available to buy in stores.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Apples requirement for a share of the revenues from subscription services accessed by their devices has been an issue in the past and it may be that this is a play by Amazon to try to force a better deal from Apple. It will certainly be interesting to see how this plays out and what the response from Apple and Google is to this.&lt;/p>

>the coming podcast surplus&lt;/a> ) by Seth Godin describes a problem (of the third world variety) that I have experienced for some time and I suspect you may have too, that is the growing number of streams of entertainment competing for my attention and time.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I have been a regular podcast listener since my first iPod many years ago when
&lt;a class="link" href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/macbreak-weekly-mp3/id179237749?mt=2" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>MacBreak Weekly&lt;/a> and the
&lt;a class="link" href="https://itunes.apple.com/gb/podcast/britishmac/id118558840?mt=2" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>BritishMac&lt;/a> Podcast were my routine companions on the drive too and from work. Since the early days of podcasting there has been a rapid growth in the number of podcast networks and shows within those networks which is great to a point. The problem comes in deciding which ones are worthy of attention and how to sample new ones whilst at the same time keeping up with the regulars.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Many of the shows I listen to average around 2 hours per episode which for me is a whole days commuting ( 1 hour in each direction ). With only 4-5 working days drives a week ( I work at home on average once a week ) it doesn&amp;rsquo;t leave much room for new podcasts to find their way onto my playlist, especially as I tend to also have an &lt;a class="link" href="http://www.audible.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>Audible&lt;/a> title on the go most of the time as well. The result of this is that I tend to continue to listen to mostly the same content and only occasionally change or add new podcasts to my player.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>My current playlist looks something like this :&lt;/p>
&lt;p>[table id=2 /]&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In addition to the regulars above I have a small list of irregular shows that I sample when I feel like it, mostly from the same podcast networks as the list above but with the odd variant thrown in for good measure. One that I dropped on a while ago that turned out to be so gripping that my regular playlist went out of the window until I had finished it was the
&lt;a class="link" href="http://serialpodcast.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>Serial Podcast&lt;/a>. This is a fascinating series of 10 episodes following a murder that happened in Baltimore in 1999 hosted by Sarah Koenig and was a spin off of This American Life. Not my normal techie faire but I really enjoyed this one and am actually looking forward to the forthcoming follow up series.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I suppose like Seth I have to accept that the reality is that I will never be able to listen to all the content that I might want to, there is simply too much to handle. It is also good news for anyone who has not yet ventured away from broadcast radio into the world of podcasts, believe me once you start you will continue and will probably not bother with commercial FM/DAB radio again !&lt;/p>

&lt;p>The question I guess then is how many people will pay to use it beyond the trial period. My own experience so far is that I will continue to use it as I am finding the new music recommendations far superior to Spotify and the fact that the whole family can use it at the same time ( for a small increase in cost ) just seals the deal.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Facebook App Draining iPhone Batteries</title><link>https://ukmac.net/p/facebook-app-draining-iphone-batteries/</link><pubDate>Tue, 28 Jul 2015 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ukmac.net/p/facebook-app-draining-iphone-batteries/</guid><description>&lt;p>According to &lt;a class="link" href="http://techcrunch.com/2015/10/15/facebook-working-on-fix-for-ios-app-battery-drain-issue/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"

Perhaps it was a bunch of irretrievable photos lost when your hard drive suddenly and inexplicably died ? Or maybe it was your lifetimes collection of music or movies, carefully downloaded and collated onto that 4TB external hard drive connected to your desktop computer that you hadn&amp;rsquo;t noticed had been accidentally deleted ?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Whichever it was, when the day arrives and you suffer that unrecoverable data loss the chances are you will be asking yourself why you hadn&amp;rsquo;t taken the time to backup to another disk.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>My preferred and recommended backup solution is an online service called
&lt;a class="link" href="http://backblaze.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>Backblaze&lt;/a>. Backblaze is cheap ( as little as $5 a month ), reliable and easy to setup and better yet, once configured you can forget it is there and relax in the knowledge that should the worst happen your data is safe and easily retrieved.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a class="link" href="https://secure.backblaze.com/r/00isdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>&lt;img src="http://ukmac.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/backblaze-trial-300x250.gif"
loading="lazy"
alt="backblaze trial"
>&lt;/a>Unlike most Internet file storage solutions (
&lt;a class="link" href="www.dropbox.com" >Dropbox&lt;/a>,
&lt;a class="link" href="onedrive.com" >OneDrive&lt;/a> etc ) the cost for Backblaze is the same whether you are backing up 100MB or 20TB ! The only difference will be the amount of time it takes to complete the initial backup, something that is getting easier as home broadband speeds steadily increase. This initial &amp;ldquo;seeding&amp;rdquo; of your backup may take some weeks to complete but it happens in the background and is carefully controlled by the
&lt;a class="link" href="www.backblaze.com" >Backblaze&lt;/a> software to not interfere with your Internet access too much. Once the first backup is complete the software then only has to update the backup when anything changes to your local data, again a process that happens in the background without manual intervention.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Backblaze will backup any of your hard drives, not just the internal drive in your PC or Mac. Just plugin your external USB drives, configure the application settings and wait for the data to be secured. One thing to note here though is that if you do this Backblaze needs to &amp;ldquo;see&amp;rdquo; that drive at least once every 30 days or it will assume the data does not need to be retained and will delete it.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Obviously paying for backup services is not sexy, it doesn&amp;rsquo;t really give you anything other than piece of mind, but it is something that everyone who has any amount of data in digital form should consider putting in place.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>If you would like to try out Backblaze you can sign up for a
&lt;a class="link" href="https://secure.backblaze.com/r/00isdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>months free trial by clicking on this link&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This post is not sponsored by Backblaze it is purely my personal choice of backup service and something that I recommend to friends and relatives when the subject arises. Please try it out, you may thank me one day !&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>For You Disappearing from iTunes after recent update</title><link>https://ukmac.net/p/for-you-disappearing-from-itunes-after-recent-update/</link><pubDate>Wed, 15 Jul 2015 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ukmac.net/p/for-you-disappearing-from-itunes-after-recent-update/</guid><description>&lt;p>Last night my MacBook&amp;rsquo;s iTunes was updated with the latest release ( 12.2.1.16 ) and when it restarted I was prompted with the invitation to Join Apple Music trial.

But what if the pre-installed templates arenât quite what you need for your current project or task ?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>There are a surprisingly small number of sites where you can find additional templates for the iWork applications. The list below contains the best ones that seem to be available at the moment. If you know of any better ones please drop a comment on this post and I will gladly update it to include them.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>iWorkCommunity.com:Template Exchange - This site is probably the most comprehensive currently available. At the time of writing there were 225 Pages templates, 5 for Keynote and 15 for Numbers. All the templates here are free to download and use.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>iWork Templates - This is a slightly more recent free template site which currently only has about 18 templates to offer.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Number Templates - This site specialises on free templates for Numbers as well as providing hints and tips on how to use the application.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Jumsoft is a commercial site providing high quality templates for iWeb, Pages and Keynote as well as clipart and animations. The Pages templates product is $39 and provides a range of 20 different templates.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Keynote Pro is another commercial site that offers a range of templates for Pages and of course Keynote. Their themes are exceptionally elegant and stylish.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Oneeyedgoldfish is a UK based company who provide a range of templates for Pages at Â£10 per theme or all of their themes for Â£40. They also have a small number of free templates for download as a taster of their full offerings.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So there you have it. A small list for now but hopefully of help anyway. Please do tell me of any other good resources for iWork by leaving a comment below.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
