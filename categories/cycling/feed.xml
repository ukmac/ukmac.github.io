&lt;p>According to my Veloviewer account (which I had fogotten I had and noticed just now that it runs out in 3 days) this year was back to my 2019 levels which is to say the worst it has been for 4 years. Nothing I didn&amp;rsquo;t already know but it does show that I have been lax this year and need to make more of an effort in 2024.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Planning rides for 2024</title><link>/p/planning-rides-for-2024/</link><pubDate>Sat, 30 Dec 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/p/planning-rides-for-2024/</guid><description>&lt;img src="/p/planning-rides-for-2024/poppyride.jpg" alt="Featured image of post Planning rides for 2024" />&lt;p>My first event of the year is now booked.

With that in mind I started spinning my way towards the top at a fairly consistent rate but with an eye on the segment details which showed the average gradient of the last segment as 10.1% !&lt;/p>
&lt;p>As I approached section 10 I was feeling a little less than fresh but still on track for a time of around 43 minutes but this last section really was tough. In my lowest gear and standing up on the pedals I was slowed to crawl but at this point being beaten was not an option.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Its fair to say I was very pleased to see the summit banner and the pool of sweat on the floor was a good indicator of how hard this climb was.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Glad to have another portal climb in the bank though.&lt;/p>

Quite a feat especially when you consider this is a fully functional bike, although I think that saddle looks a little less than comfortable.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>I should have gone with my gut this afternoon when I was planning a short ride. Just before I set off the clouds opened and it poured down. I had just checked on my weather app and it did say no rain so I decided it was just a short downpour and I should go for it.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The first 10 minutes were ok but by the time I reached &lt;a class="link" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kynnersley" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>Kynnersley&lt;/a> it was raining again and slowly got heavier. I ploughed on as I hadn&amp;rsquo;t been out on the roads for a while and wanted to do at least 30k. By the time I reached the turn for Ollerton/Childs Ercall I was well and truly soaked and so decided to take the corner off the ride and not go to Ollerton and to head straight to [Childs Ercall(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Child%27s_Ercall)] instead. This turned out to be the wrong choice. As I took the right hand turn to Childs Ercall I felt the back wheel go and before I knew where I was I was on my side on the edge of the road ! Not what I had planned.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Fortunately I was largely unhurt apart from my right arm having a nice bit of road rash. Thankfully it is a quiet country lane and there were no cars around.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>After straightening my handlebars and brushing myself down I continued on with the rest of the wet ride home. This was my first spill on a bike for many years but it didn&amp;rsquo;t make it feel any less embarrassing that I had fallen off.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I suspect tonight I will feel the impact of this fall as the bruising comes through but at least I am in one piece and ready to ride again, albeit I will probably take it a little more gingerley on the corners when the roads are wet next time.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Today was my first proper ride for over a couple of weeks and also my first go on the new [Zwift Portal(https://zwiftinsider.com/climb-portal-list/)] routes. I was prompted to try &lt;a class="link" href="https://zwiftinsider.com/portal/crow-road/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>Crow Rd&lt;/a> on the Zwift rides home screen so I decided I would give it a go. At 6.9km this is not a particularly long climb but after not riding for a while and with legs that still felt a little on the weak side it may have turned out to be a bad idea.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The route is 251m of elevation and the steppest parts of the route are thankfully in the first km so you can get those bits over early and then settle into a slightly easier average gradient for the next 4-5km.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Starting an early ride in late August in the UK can be tricky when making decisions about clothing, too much and by the time you get going you are cooking and too little and the early part of your ride can be on the chilly side. This morning I went for a thin base layer, short sleeve jersey and shorts which turned out to be a wise choice. It was pretty cool at 7am as I headed towards Edgmond, the balloons from the &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-shropshire-62689463" target="_blank" rel="noopener"

&lt;p>My planned route was a &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.komoot.com/tour/905565828" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>50K loop to Cheswardine&lt;/a> returning via Stoke on Tern and Childs Ercall. I have done this route a couple of times and it is a pleasant ride with very little traffic. In fact today during the entire ride I was only past ( from behind ) by 5 cars, three of which were in the final 3k of the ride as I got close to home.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The route is pretty flat with the only real uphill section taking you from the Chester Road after St Michaels Church, Chetwynd along &lt;a class="link" href="https://travelshropshire.co.uk/cycle/cycle-routes/national-cycle-network/regional-cycle-route-75.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noopener"

&lt;th>Katie is a long distance specialist who loves to climb hills. She posts regularly and has a large following of over 100k subscribers. One of my favourite channels and one that I look forward to new episodes of.&lt;/th>

&lt;th>Adam is not the most regular YouTuber but he is definitely my favourite. A seasoned Audaxer who covers huge distances a lot of which he does on a fixie ! He has a great sense of humour ( at least I think so ) and a unique style.. Watch out for gout !&lt;/th>

&lt;th>Dave&amp;rsquo;s channel is a mixture of gravel rides, BMX with his daughter, new bike builds and a variety of races and events. I have to admit when I first watched Dave&amp;rsquo;s channel I was a bit put off by his quirky style, but stick with him, he is developing his style and is actually quite refreshing&lt;/th>

&lt;th>Juliet is the ex-partner of Dave Noakes and is another 100k+ subscriber channel that goes back over 12 years. Juliet is a bubbly presenter who was a pro-snow boarder, BMXer and cycle courier amongst many other things I&amp;rsquo;m sure. The channel is a mix of gravel riding, backpacking and competitive crit rides.&lt;/th>

&lt;th>Leonards channel is a little different to the typical cycling YouTube channel. Leonard is a 50+ year old who is &amp;ldquo;gravitationally challenged (quote)&amp;rdquo; and his channel is aimed more at the new cyclist or the returning cyclist who is perhaps not ready for 200km Audax&amp;rsquo;s just yet.&lt;/th>

For my part Christmas was quiet and fairly relaxed and as usual over quicker than you can imagine. The actual day this year did feel quite &amp;ldquo;christmassy&amp;rdquo; due to the morning frost and clear blue sky which was really nice. Today on the first Boxing Day of 2020 (the second official one is on Monday) was slightly less so although it did manage to stay dry here in Telford until after dark. Tonight we are in for a bit of a storm as Storm Bella makes her way across the country.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I did manage to get out on my bike this afternoon for a &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.strava.com/activities/4520655463/embed/b8a01a92293e813e84ef5915c4bbb24aab9c3616" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>quick 25k&lt;/a> before dark which was nice especially as the roads were really quiet (almost like being back in the first lockdown again). My route tonight didnt take wind direction into account though so after an quick assisted outbound ride the return was a little slower as I battled into the early part of Storm Bella.&lt;/p>

>The Camphill Village Trust&lt;/a> asked if I would be interested in doing a sponsored bike ride for the charities 65th anniversary which is this year. I was of course up for it and we originally planned on an early Summer event riding from our offices in Stourbridge to one of our sites in Gloucestershire (Taurus Crafts) which was coincidentally 65 miles away (105k).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Shortly after making these preliminary plans we went into the first national lockdown and the plans got parked for another day. Yesterday we finally managed to fit the ride in and so far have raised over £1000 as well.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The ride we undertook was planned on Komoot and is &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.komoot.com/tour/279396580" target="_blank" rel="noopener"

I had planned a 50 loop on Komoot parts of which we familiar to me but a few bits that were new. The new bits turned out to include a couple of short off road sections, the first of which was easy enough, but the second not so much. After taking a left onto a farm track at Howle and riding about 1km up a steady hill the track just disappeared into a mass of hedgerow, nettles and brambles. Despite my best efforts and the fact that I could hear the road that I was trying to get to behind the fields to my right, I couldn&amp;rsquo;t find a way through and ended up re-tracing my steps down the track and back onto the main road. I suppose this is part of the risk with planning a route on Komoot, the paths may not always be what you expect, but it does make for an interesting morning.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Until recently I hadn&amp;rsquo;t seen an easy way of tracking progress on Zwift without actually sitting on my bike, launching Zwift, starting a ride and then navigating to the achievements section. The Zwift companion app does a fairly poor job of showing you historical activity other than the chronological list of activities completed. Then I came across &lt;a class="link" href="https://youtu.be/KgSfajJzW6M" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>this video from GPLama&lt;/a> in which he explains how to use a third party web site called &lt;a class="link" href="https://zwifthub.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>Zwifthub&lt;/a> to keep track of all your Zwift badges and achievements. You can setup a Zwifthub account or login with a Google account (unfortunately there is no direct link to your Zwift account) and manually update your profile with all your achievements to date. After that you can use the simple filters in the web site sidebar to show you which routes you have completed, which are still to be done, which are available to ride today and then further sort the lists by distance, elevation, gradient etc.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The site is simple in focus but very well executed and fills the gap left by Zwift extremely well. I would imagine that many other Zwifters would find this service useful or at least interesting, even if they are not aiming to complete all the routes and badges on Zwift.&lt;/p>

>Zwift&lt;/a> for me. Finally after about 18 months of rides I passed the 50,000m climbing needed to be awarded the &lt;a class="link" href="https://zwiftinsider.com/tron-bike/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>Zwift Concept Z1&lt;/a> better known by Zwifters as the Tron Bike !&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Prior to my ride yesterday I had around 800m of climb left to do so decided what better way to knock off those last metres than to do it on &lt;a class="link" href="https://zwiftinsider.com/massive-alpe-du-zwift-climb-released/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>Alpe du Zwift&lt;/a>. I was about 3/4 of the way up when the notification popped onto the screen to say I had been awarded the Tron bike. As you can see from the picture I took the opportunity when I got to the top to quickly change over to my new steed for the ride down again (with suitably large smile on my face!)&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Happy cyclist :)&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
