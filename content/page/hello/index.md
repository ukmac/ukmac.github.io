Hello, I'm Scott Paterson.

Here is how I prefer to keep in touch, and why:

- My favourite way to converse is email.
- I mainly write on my website.  To see what I'm focusing on, I have a now page. 
- I have left Twitter or "X" because it is a cesspool.
- I lurk on Mastodon and make the occasional comment or post
- I dislike LinkedIn as a platform, but use it to connect with work colleagues. I don't use it for ongoing communication, I'd rather email.
- I use Strava to publish my walks/rides and to check on my friends progress
- I have a Pixelfed account and really should use it but life...
- I do not use Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp or Threads.

This is an example of a Hello page. If you would like to make your own to encourage better communication, and share it with me, I would be happy to link to it.
