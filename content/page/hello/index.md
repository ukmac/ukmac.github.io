Hello, I'm Scott Paterson.

Here is how I prefer to keep in touch, and why:

- My favourite way to converse is [email](mailto://scott@ukmac.net).
- If you know me and have my phone number you can contact me on iMessage or Signal
- I try to write on my [website](https://ukmac.net) though not on a very regular basis
- I have left Twitter or "X" because it is a cesspool.
- I lurk on [Mastodon](https://twit.social/@ukmac) and make the occasional comment or post
- I am not a huge fan of [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/scottpaterson1/), but use it to connect with work colleagues. I don't use it for ongoing communication, I'd rather email.
- I use [Strava](https://www.strava.com/athletes/2570377) to publish my walks/rides and to check on my friends progress
- I love [Zwift](https://www.zwift.com/uk/athlete/1025930) and try to ride as often as I can
- I have a [Pixelfed](https://pixelfed.social/i/web/profile/494993806810578139) account and really should use it more.
- I don't use Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp or Threads
- 

This is an example of a [Hello](https://alastairjohnston.com/introducing-hello-pages/) page an idea by Alastair Johnston. I liked his template and this is mine...
