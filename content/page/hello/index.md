Hello, I'm Scott Paterson.

Here is how I prefer to keep in touch, and why:

- My favourite way to converse is [email](mailto://scott@ukmac.net).
- I mainly write on my [website](https://ukmac.net).  To see what I'm focusing on, I have a now page. 
- I have left Twitter or "X" because it is a cesspool.
- I lurk on [Mastodon](https://twit.social/@ukmac) and make the occasional comment or post
- I dislike LinkedIn as a platform, but use it to connect with work colleagues. I don't use it for ongoing communication, I'd rather email.
- I use [Strava](https://www.strava.com/athletes/2570377) to publish my walks/rides and to check on my friends progress
- I have a Pixelfed account and really should use it but life...
- I do not use Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp or Threads.

This is an example of a [Hello](https://alastairjohnston.com/introducing-hello-pages/) page an idea by Alastair Johnston. I liked his template and this is mine...
