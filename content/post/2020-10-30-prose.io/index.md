title: Updating Jekyll from iPad with Prose.io
tags:

So I setup this Jekyll blog a few months ago and as usual after getting it going I promptly let it languish. One of the issues I guess is that unlike Wordpress there is no quick iOS or web app out of the box to update Jekyll sites from my phone or iPad.

Enter [Prose.io](https://prose.io).

Prose.io is an elegant and clean web app for managing Github sites and [CMS Free web sites](https://medium.com/devseed/how-we-build-cms-free-websites-d7e19d94a0ff) which also works very nicely on iPads (no app required). To start editing a Jekyll web site all you have to do is go to [https://prose.io](https://prose.io) and authenticate with your Github account. You can then open your sites posts folder and either edit existing posts or create new ones.

This article is the first I have created using the site. The editor is fairly minimal but does have a simple formatting toolbar and a Markdown preview button for checking that your post looks ok before saving and committing changes to Github.

I will be testing this out with future posts but from what I can see this may well be the ideal way to update my site and certainly easier than trying to work with Github clients on iOS.
