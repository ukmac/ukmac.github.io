[Last weeks ride](https://ukmac.net/p/a-lesson-in-how-not-to-ride-in-the-rain/) couldn't have been more different from todays. I wasn't sure I would get time to go out this afternoon but when the opportunity of a quick hour circuit raised its head I didn't wait for it to pass by.

Only 40K today but still enough to blow the cobwebs away and get me ready for a week at the home office.
