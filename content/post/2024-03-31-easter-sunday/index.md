After much deliberation I finally ordered a new M3 MacBook Air from Amazon last week after I spotted a 16Gb/512Gb version going for Â£100 off list price. I am not sure why this model was available as Amazon typically only have the 8Gb versions available. There was only one colour available, Starlight, but for the reduction in price I decided I could live with something other than Space Grey for a change.

I was given Tuesday 26th as the delivery date but after waiting all day for a delivery up to 10pm the status of my order was changed to "We will email you when we have a delivery date". This was more than a little disappointing. I waited a couple of days before contacting Amazon for an update and after a brief call I was told it would be with me this week but no precise date was given. I was surprised then to get an update on Friday morning to say it had been despatched and would be with me by 7pm, it arrived safely around 5pm.

I have been a happy owner of a 16" M1 MacBook Pro (which I upgraded to from an original M1 MacBook Air with 8Gb) for the last couple of years and really didn't **need** an upgrade but I longed for something a little more portable than the 16" which is a wonderful powerful laptop but not exactly featherweight. Practically I am hopeful that the M3 Air will deliver similar performance to my Pro in a much more lightweight package, especially as my workload doesn't involve a lot of processor heavy applications. I am also hoping that the second hand re-sale value of the MacBook Pro will pretty much cover the cost of the brand new Air.

I have had a couple of days with the new Air now and have mostly got things setup how I like them again and as expected it really feels no different to the Pro apart from when I pick it up from the desk to take it to another room. I don't travel too much these days so carrying any distance is not a big issue but sitting with it on my lap feels so much more comfortable than the the 16" Pro.
