I am in Scarborough today for a site visit to one of our new services to spec out the requirements for their network. I arrived last night after a four hour drive and will probably be on site for half an hour today before starting the return four hour drive home. A long way for a short visit but better to see the site in person than to try and design the network from plans.

It was a nostalgic drive through York/Malton and the North Yorks Moors through which I have driven many times in the past. I love this part of the country, the villages are all very pretty and the landscape is rugged and open (and harsh in the winter).
