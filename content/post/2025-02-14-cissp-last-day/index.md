Today is the final day of my week long training course (CISSP) with [The Knowledge Academy](https://www.theknowledgeacademy.com/). It has been a bit of a slog to be honest, 750 slides over five days means not an awful lot of time for interaction with fellow students. Add to that the fact that of the 14 candidates on the Zoom call only two or three of us have had our webcams on during the course meant that the discussion amongst the group has been pretty minimal.

CISSP is not deeply technical but is very broad in scope covering all aspects of Information Security from lighting of access to buildings to how crypto works. Practically I haven't actually learned huge amounts that I didnt already know but the training has given me a good idea of the likely content of the exam, should I take it (the exam alone is nearly Â£600 in the UK). From the outset the trainer did explain that the course itself is probably not sufficient to pass the exam and I think after sitting through it I would probably agree. If you had little knowledge of the subject matter before taking this course you probably wouldn't have learned what you need in the last five days and I think that is expected. To obtain the qualification you not only have to pass the exam but you also have to prove that you have at least five years experience in a field related to two of the eight domains of the course.
