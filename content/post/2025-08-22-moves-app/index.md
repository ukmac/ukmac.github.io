A new favourite utility app for MacOS is [Moves](https://mikkelmalmberg.com/moves) by Mikkel Malmberg. Moves is a very simple app that allows you to move and resize windows without mousing to the corners of the app or the top of the app window. Just point anywhere in the app window and press the move or re-size hotkey set in the app (I am using Command+Shift for Move and Option+Shift for resize) and move the mouse to drag or resize that app. Simple but really nice.
