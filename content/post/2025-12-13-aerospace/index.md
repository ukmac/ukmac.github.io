[Aerospace](https://nikitabobko.github.io/AeroSpace/guide) is my new favourite macOS app....

My daily work involves a LOT of open browsers and applications (Word, Excel etc) and finding a way to navigate the many browser windows/tabs and applications has been an ongoing journey. Along the way I have used [BetterTouch Tool](https://folivora.ai/), [Keyboard Maestro](https://www.keyboardmaestro.com/), [Moom](https://manytricks.com/moom/), Apple Spaces and many other combinations of these and other applications.

My latest incarnation of these tools had been working reasonably well for me (to a point) but then I happened across [Aerospace](https://nikitabobko.github.io/AeroSpace/guide). After delving into a number of YouTube videos I found [this one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-FoWClVHG5g&t=22s). This wasn't the first YouTube video on Aerospace I had seen but it was certainly the clearest and easiest to follow.

After watching this video I installed Aerospace with [brew](https://brew.sh) and opened Aerospace.toml in VS Code and got to work on configuring for my needs. After a couple of weeks of tinkering I am now really happy with the way Aerospace works for me. I have a number of workspaces setup, Home, Admin, Personal, Code, Outlook, Word, Excel and Music, each with a corresponding 'on-window-detected' callback that sends the apps I have designated to the correct workspace. This works great and means windows immediately tile how I want them on the workspace I want them on.

Aerospace is certainly not the simplest window manager for macOS but it really is configurable to exactly your needs as long as a bit of 'coding' in the configuration file (aerospace.toml) doesn't put you off.

Definitely recommended..
