It has been a bit of a slog to be honest, 750 slides over five days means not an awful lot of time for interaction with fellow students. Add to that the fact that of the 14 candidates on the Zoom call only two or three of us have had our webcams on during the course meant that the discussion amongst the group has been pretty minimal.\nCISSP is not deeply technical but is very broad in scope covering all aspects of Information Security from lighting of access to buildings to how crypto works. Practically I haven\u0026rsquo;t actually learned huge amounts that I didnt already know but the training has given me a good idea of the likely content of the exam, should I take it (the exam alone is nearly £600 in the UK). From the outset the trainer did explain that the course itself is probably not sufficient to pass the exam and I think after sitting through it I would probably agree. If you had little knowledge of the subject matter before taking this course you probably wouldn\u0026rsquo;t have learned what you need in the last five days and I think that is expected. To obtain the qualification you not only have to pass the exam but you also have to prove that you have at least five years experience in a field related to two of the eight domains of the course.\nDaily Links Link Description ISC2 - CISSP Certified Information Systems Security Professional The Knowledge Academy UK based Training provider Handshake A short story with a twist from Matt Gemmell ","date":"2025-02-14T09:01:00Z","image":"https://ukmac.net/p/final-day-of-cissp-course/cissp_hu2c4605eb78543e9689618a2cc8c85ca2_38854_120x120_fill_q75_box_smart1.jpg","permalink":"https://ukmac.net/p/final-day-of-cissp-course/","title":"Final day of CISSP course"},{"content":"This site is brought to you by Hugo and Github Pages.\nAs much as I would love to be an expert in web design and publishing I have to admit I am not.

The solution was made possible in part thanks to Microsoft CoPilot which I am finding increasingly useful for various aspects of my work and personal life.

I am not sure why this model was available as Amazon typically only have the 8Gb versions available. There was only one colour available, Starlight, but for the reduction in price I decided I could live with something other than Space Grey for a change.\nI was given Tuesday 26th as the delivery date but after waiting all day for a delivery up to 10pm the status of my order was changed to \u0026ldquo;We will email you when we have a delivery date\u0026rdquo;. This was more than a little disappointing. I waited a couple of days before contacting Amazon for an update and after a brief call I was told it would be with me this week but no precise date was given. I was surprised then to get an update on Friday morning to say it had been despatched and would be with me by 7pm, it arrived safely around 5pm.\nI have been a happy owner of a 16\u0026quot; M1 MacBook Pro (which I upgraded to from an original M1 MacBook Air with 8Gb) for the last couple of years and really didn\u0026rsquo;t need an upgrade but I longed for something a little more portable than the 16\u0026quot; which is a wonderful powerful laptop but not exactly featherweight. Practically I am hopeful that the M3 Air will deliver similar performance to my Pro in a much more lightweight package, especially as my workload doesn\u0026rsquo;t involve a lot of processor heavy applications. I am also hoping that the second hand re-sale value of the MacBook Pro will pretty much cover the cost of the brand new Air.\nI have had a couple of days with the new Air now and have mostly got things setup how I like them again and as expected it really feels no different to the Pro apart from when I pick it up from the desk to take it to another room. I don\u0026rsquo;t travel too much these days so carrying any distance is not a big issue but sitting with it on my lap feels so much more comfortable than the the 16\u0026quot; Pro.\nEssential apps For info the list of essential apps I have re-installed include :-\nRaycast Keyboard Maestro Espanso Forklift Visual Studio Code Obsidian Dato Shottr Readkit IceCubes for Mastodon Obsidian Sync One of the other things I have been changing in the last month is my Obsidian setup. Obsidian is an application that I have been trying to use for a long time but one of the main things that prevented my adoption was the fact that I wanted to be able to sync across Windows, macOS and iOS. Of course the simple answer to this would have been to subscribe to the Obsidian Sync service but I was loathe to start another subscription especially as I had yet to fully develop an essential workflow that relied on Obsidian.\nIts fair to say that I am one of those types who prefer the configuration and setup of systems to actually using them and have tried and failed to make every type of note taking system and tool work for me. Having said that I have watched endless videos on note taking tools and Obsidian is the one that I have always thought should be able to serve my needs well.\nPrior to this month I had been using the Obsidian Git plugin with a reasonable amount of success, but have had numerous instances of sync issues caused by opening my vault on my MacBook and iPhone or iPad when there were uncommitted changes which then required command line tinkering to rollback changes. This sort of irritation is a big negative factor in adopting a smooth workflow as you will appreciate, so last month I finally submitted to another subscription and signed up to the entry level $4 a month plan.\nThe impact was immediate. Sync now just works including plugin installations and configuration settings which didn\u0026rsquo;t sync at all with my Git based solution which meant I was constantly making changes to multiple devices to keep plugin settings synchronised.\nI am very happy with this setup at the moment and will continue with it for a few months on the monthly plan and if it looks like becoming a permenant part of my toolbox I will sign up for the annual plan to save a few quid. If you havent tried it yet and have been testing across multiple devices with Git or iCloud sync then I would definitely recommend setting up a monthly Obsidian Sync subscription for a month or two to test it out.\n","date":"2024-03-31T00:00:00Z","image":"https://ukmac.net/p/easter-sunday-new-macbook/macbookair_hu10ce398fce440b523c842c534dfc558b_267530_120x120_fill_q75_box_smart1.jpg","permalink":"https://ukmac.net/p/easter-sunday-new-macbook/","title":"Easter Sunday - New MacBook"},{"content":"12th Jan means my birthday and another year under the bridge of life\u0026hellip;\nToday started with a walk to the Hundred Acre Kitchen for coffee and sausage and egg sandwiches with Vel.

Feeling over indulged I am starting to think about new years resolutions and in particular how to get back to regular exercise.

Intentions of 30 mins on Zwift at lunch time have very often fallen by the wayside.\nThe answer will be to learn to set standards and to say no.

Oddly running is something I tend to find I do more of in the winter, I find running in the hot weather uncomfortable and would much rather be cycling through the lanes for exercise in the Summer.

The M3 is another incremental improvement over the previous generations Apple Silicon so it was interesting that most of the performance comparisons that Apple made during the event were between the M1 and M3 processors rather than between M2 and M3.\nI suppose the point of making this comparison is to encourage early Apple Silicon adopters who are on M1 machines to upgrade even though for most users those M1 based Macs are still going to be fine for almost all uses. This is also why the event repeatedly referred to high end/power users. Its very clear the M3 Pro MacBooks are targetted to heavy users (video, simulation, audio production etc). This will be a challenge for Apple moving forward. Whilst two year iPhone upgrades cycles are commonplace for many users MacBooks and Macs tend to be on longer upgrade cycles and the new Apple Silicon Macs are SO fast and powerful this cycle will potentially be able to stretch even longer.

Google has a few odd pages indexed at the moment out of the approx 200 pages in this site but Bing stubbornly refuses to index any of the site and so as far as searches on Bing is concerned ukmac.net may as well not exist.\nThis is something I have been trying to fix for the last few weeks without any real progress and the more I dig the more I find other web site owners, some with much more popular sites than mine, who are also experiencing the same issues. What I can\u0026rsquo;t tell is why Bing seems to dislike my site. Microsoft have a set of guidelines which supposedly tell site owners how to fix issues getting their sites indexed but they really don\u0026rsquo;t help much.\nAny site owners experiencing this issue will be very familiar with the screen shot above which is the error received in the Bing Webmaster Tools site when you run a URL Inspection against your site.\nThe odd and very frustrating thing with this is that if you select the Live URL view at the top of the URL Inspection screen you will likely see something like this\u0026hellip;\nThe issue is the \u0026ldquo;quality checks\u0026rdquo; that it refers to that I assume my site is failing are not detailed anywhere. How do you know what needs fixing ? Read the webmasters guidelines apparently but this doesnt help to show which ones your site is failing on.\nLast night I found a forum post which suggested emailing Bing webmaster tech support on bwtsupport@microsoft.com for advice. I wasn\u0026rsquo;t convinced I would get a reply but thought there was nothing lost in trying this. Amazingly I got a reply within an hour with a case number and even more amazingly within another 9 hours I had a reply from a real person. The response explained that the case had been investigated and my site had been manually checked and that I had been found to be in violation of the Bing Webmaster Guidelines and as such my site would not be indexed and I was referred to check out the guidelines for help in resolving the issue. Great. IF they would tell me what the issue was ?\nAt this point I am sort of losing the will to carry on with this. I\u0026rsquo;m sure there are people out there who can assist with this and perhaps most of them would suggest my site is not worth Bing indexing it, and they may be right, but my techie self is still annoyed and frustrated at being beaten by this.\nTo be honest, I think I will continue to dabble with this site despite the lack of traffic due to being in a black hole. The site itself I think looks better than it has done before and site building with Hugo is teaching me a lot about Git, Visual Studio Code and Markdown which is something.\nIn the meantime if any web gurus do happen across my site and can shed any light or offer any advice on how to get indexed by Bing I would be very grateful to hear from you.\nUseful Links Link Description Bing Webmaster Guidelines Bing advice on how to get your site indexed.

Just before I set off the clouds opened and it poured down. I had just checked on my weather app and it did say no rain so I decided it was just a short downpour and I should go for it.\nThe first 10 minutes were ok but by the time I reached Kynnersley it was raining again and slowly got heavier. I ploughed on as I hadn\u0026rsquo;t been out on the roads for a while and wanted to do at least 30k. By the time I reached the turn for Ollerton/Childs Ercall I was well and truly soaked and so decided to take the corner off the ride and not go to Ollerton and to head straight to [Childs Ercall(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Child%27s_Ercall)] instead. This turned out to be the wrong choice. As I took the right hand turn to Childs Ercall I felt the back wheel go and before I knew where I was I was on my side on the edge of the road ! Not what I had planned.\nFortunately I was largely unhurt apart from my right arm having a nice bit of road rash. Thankfully it is a quiet country lane and there were no cars around.\nAfter straightening my handlebars and brushing myself down I continued on with the rest of the wet ride home. This was my first spill on a bike for many years but it didn\u0026rsquo;t make it feel any less embarrassing that I had fallen off.\nI suspect tonight I will feel the impact of this fall as the bruising comes through but at least I am in one piece and ready to ride again, albeit I will probably take it a little more gingerley on the corners when the roads are wet next time.\n","date":"2023-08-26T00:00:00Z","image":"https://ukmac.net/p/a-lesson-in-how-not-to-ride-in-the-rain/strava_huf989d7231a9550b03d51e3dfeac60763_233772_120x120_fill_q75_box_smart1.jpg","permalink":"https://ukmac.net/p/a-lesson-in-how-not-to-ride-in-the-rain/","title":"A lesson in how not to ride in the rain"},{"content":"A big day for the Indian space programme and a poke in the eye for the Russians who crashed landed their attempt earlier in the week.\n","date":"2023-08-23T00:00:00Z","image":"https://ukmac.net/p/india-moon-landing/chandrayaan_hu15fc7c41d4cdf99aabf3d789bb0dac69_26936_120x120_fill_q75_box_smart1.jpg","permalink":"https://ukmac.net/p/india-moon-landing/","title":"India Moon Landing"},{"content":"Preparations Camping in the rain can be a little disappointing but its something British campers tend to get used to. This trip was to be the first for my daughters who had never been on a family camping trip before despite both being in their late teens. They had camped with school but wanted to have an family camping experience so we had planned a one night trial run to see how they got on. I had been watching the weather reports in the run up to the day and was expecting light rain in the morning so it wasn\u0026rsquo;t unexpected when I woke to a grey and damp morning.\nBy about 9am the girls were up and we started to get our things together for the trip to the Shropshire Hills.\nCancelled The drive to our campsite was only about 30 miles but the last few mile were down narrow lanes and the last mile along a rough and steep farm track. We got to the farm yard and there didn’t seem to be anyone around so I called the number of the farm. The guy I had spoken to yesterday answered and said he was sorry but there was no way we could drive to the pitches as the overnight rain had left the access road too slippery to drive, he said he couldn’t get up it in his Land Rover Discovery. He said he had text me earlier in the morning to say we shouldn’t come but I hadn’t seen the message.\nThe Hollies Farm To say we were disappointed would have been an understatement. Our options were to abandon completely or try and find an alternative camp site. A couple of miles before the turn to lower Vellons farm we had seen a sign for a “glamping” site so we decided to head there and see if we could get a pitch for the night. When we arrived it was a flat field with a bunch of clamping pods on a very nicely laid out plot but no sign of tents so I wasn’t hopeful of getting a pitch. Sure enough the lady at the office said they weren’t allowed tents due to their planning permission for the site but she very helpfully rang another site, The Hollies, for me who told her they would take a tent. She gave me directions and told me to pitch up in the field and the owner would come and see us later. We would know we had the right place as there was one other tent there already.\nGetting setup A short drive later and we were on a small field overlooking a fabulous view of the Shropshire hills. The rain was still drizzling and there was quite a breeze blowing so I anticipated a struggle to get the tent up as we had only tried it twice before. The first time was also windy and Ria and I gave up as we couldn’t manage to get the hooped poles in place whilst stopping the wind from trying to blow us away. The second time we managed to get it up ok after a bit of a struggle pushing the poles into place. This time there were three of us and we needed to get the tent up quickly to get out of the rain.\nAmazingly we had the poles in and the outer pegged down in just a few minutes and with barely a crossed word. Teamwork it seems worked for us.\nOnce we had the outer up we got the bedroom inners in place in a few more minutes and within a short space of time we were setup with camp chairs and the little stove boiling some water for tea and lunch. Perfect.\nWalking the Stiperstones Once we had eaten we set off for a walk up to the Stiperstones. A short walk up the lane took us through a farm yard which led to the gate to the Shropshire Way. We took a left aiming to walk to the West end of the ridge that leads up to the Devils Chair before descending back down to the Hollies Farm for the return.\nThe first part of the route was through a small wood with a brook running down the right of the path. Once we emerged out of the woods we were on a bracken and heather lined path which after a short walk turned right back on ourselves and headed up to where we could see the Devils Chair shrouded by low clouds. The wind was blowing pretty hard at this point and we were all getting pretty wet, but then as we reached the Shropshire Way the cloud cleared and we quickly dried out courtesy of the continuing strong winds.\nThe ridge across the top of the Stiperstones is strewn with irregular and jagged stones which makes progress pretty slow and quite treacherous, a twisted ankle would be pretty easy to acquire and would make the return leg of the walk very uncomfortable.\nDescent Despite the conditions the walk along the summit was enjoyable and the views by this time were spectacular, the panorama surrounding us reaching into Wales and across the Shropshire peaks. Soon we were at the point where we could turn back down the hill side towards the campsite and before long we were out of the wind and back onto much smoother terrain, crossing the fields in front of the Hollies Farm, complete with a herd of cows who mercifully seemed uninterested in us, before joining the short lane to our tent.\nStiperstones Inn After resting at the tent for an hour or so we changed and headed in the car to the Stiperstones Inn for our evening meal. The Inn is a proper traditional English country pub with a menu that included steak and kidney suet pudding and apple crumble and custard for dessert\u0026hellip; Superb stuff.\nOnce we had availed ourselves of the Inn WiFi and eaten our fill it was time to head back to the tent for a well earned night under canvas.\nThe evening air had already started to cool when we got out of the car and the girls commented on it being cold, but once we were in our campbeds and snuggled down the complaints soon stopped. I was certainly glad to be in bed and despite a slow puncture on my airbed that gradually deflated through the night leaving me on the floor in the morning I slept pretty soundly and the girls were quiet until 7am the next morning when we woke to a spectacular sunny morning\u0026hellip;\nTBC\n","date":"2023-08-16T00:00:00Z","image":"https://ukmac.net/p/camping-in-the-shropshire-hills-day-1/holliesfarm_hu65b283acde9b105157da8e453ca6c429_115963_120x120_fill_q75_box_smart1.jpg","permalink":"https://ukmac.net/p/camping-in-the-shropshire-hills-day-1/","title":"Camping in the Shropshire Hills - Day 1"},{"content":"Crow Road Today was my first proper ride for over a couple of weeks and also my first go on the new [Zwift Portal(https://zwiftinsider.com/climb-portal-list/)] routes.

I had looked at them a number of times over the last year or so but had never seen one in person until I was on site with one of the team from IT Naturally who was using hers to make notes during a site device upgrade that we were carrying out. When I spoke to her she was gushing with praise and said it was the best thing she had bought. I guess this got me interested, then a few days later I learned that my manager also had one and was also really impressed with it. That swung it and I went online and ordered a refurb to be delivered straight away.\nreMarkable offer a 100 day money back guarantee which was one of the reasons that I decided it was worth a go, I could always return it if I didn\u0026rsquo;t get on well with it. The reason I went for a refurb was also due to this no arguement return policy. reMarkable obviously have people who return devices for whatever reason and re-selling these at a small saving with the same guarantee as a brand new one makes a lot of sense.\nFirst impressions When I received my notebook a few days later the immediate reaction was that there really was no difference from a brand new device. The box was shrink wrapped as new and when opened there was no way I would have been able to tell that someone had previously used this tablet, it was really mint condition.\nCompared with most tablets the reMarkable is amazingly thin and light, it really is an impressive feat of technology. Once powered up the screen appeared crisp and clear and I was quickly through the setup wizard and having a go at the writing experience. I had opted against buying the reMarkable stylus and case preferring to go for the much more modestly priced Staedtler Noris digital classic stylus from Amazon which was less than £30 compared to £59 for the basic reMarkable Marker and a crazy £109 for the reMarkable Marker Plus !\nreMarkable Connect The new device comes with 12 months subscription to the reMarkable Connect service which promises to save your notes to the cloud and additionally sync them to apps on your phone/tablet or PC. I setup the required account and installed the app on my iPhone, Macbook and iPad. I then started testing, creating a few pages and trying out the solution. After creating a few test pages I deleted them from the notebook and created a real notebook ready to start using. After a few minutes I noticed the test pages I had deleted had re-appeared on the notebook\u0026hellip; A little odd I thought and deleted them again only for them to re-appear again a few minutes later. Annoyed now I did a quick search for this issue and quickly found a number of threads that suggested it was the iOS apps causing the re-appearing pages, apparently the sync process is not 100% reliable. This was annoying as this was one of the things I expected I might use. I removed/logged out of the apps on my other devices and did some more testing and sure enough no further re-appearing deleted pages.\nFurther Impressions Over the last month I have tried to use the reMarkable (without the mobile apps) and have been torn. On the one hand the device is really nice, slick, thin, light and the writing experience is extremely good, far superior to using a pen on an iPad. The problem for me though was the software. The sync issue was an annoyance but was compounded by the functionality of the device software itself. My main issue is search or the lack of. The notes you write CAN be converted to searchable text but once you do that they are now text not handwritten notes and you also have to accept any errors in conversion. You cant search handwritten notes, something that OneNote has done for years.\nFurther you cant name the pages of your notes to allow for searching by page name. This would be a major improvement for me. I create a page for each day in a daily notes journal and once created the only way to navigate or go back to a specific days notes is to use the thumbnail view of the notes pages. Each page is numbered but the thumbnail is too small text to easily spot a specific page so you end up having to open a page that you think then skip forward or backward until you find the required page. Given the slow refresh of eink displays this is not a quick process, certainly when compared to skimming through the pages of a paper journal.\nAnd it is this limitation that has brought me to today when I have finally decided to return my reMarkable for a refund. Honestly if the device was half the price I might not have bothered but at £300 this is not a cheap piece of kit and given my difficulties using it in my wy of working I decided I would rather have the £300 back. I am a little disappointed but part of the original reason for buying was the knowledge that if it didn\u0026rsquo;t work for me I could return it so I am happy to have tried.\nMaybe reMarkable 3 will rectify some of these issues when it is eventually released and I might be tempted to give it another go\u0026hellip;\n","date":"2023-08-09T00:00:00Z","image":"https://ukmac.net/p/my-remarkable-notebook/remarkable_hu74c371bda13bfb186cfabc017dd54280_74845_120x120_fill_q75_box_smart1.jpg","permalink":"https://ukmac.net/p/my-remarkable-notebook/","title":"My reMarkable notebook"},{"content":"A couple of weeks ago I got a text out of the blue from an old friend, James who had just heard that another friend of ours, Will Green, had unfortunately passed away.\nI hadn\u0026rsquo;t heard from Will or spoken to him in some time but the out of the blue call from James did leave me winded. James and I spoke for quite a while, reminiscing about things and I think both of us could not quite believe it. Our friendship came about through our love of Apple Mac computers and a strange coincidence of geography.\nMy interest in Macs started when I bought an 17\u0026quot; G5 iMac in 2005. At the time my work life was entirely Windows centric and I think I recall deciding to buy a Mac mostly out of curiosity. I was of course quickly sold by the elegance, slick design and polished software.\nI think soon after I bought into the Mac lifestyle I registered this domain (ukmac.net) and started with my early blog focused on Apple and my new Mac. As a keen Apple fan I of course started consuming what I could from the Internet from various web sites/blogs and also from a number of podcasts such as Macbreak Weekly and the wildly eccentric BritishMac podcast.\nBritishMac was a regular chart topper in the podcast Tech charts in those days and by a bizarre twist of fate was run by Will who happened to live only a few miles from me in Ironbridge, Shropshire. Through another weird coincidence I came into contact with James who had also recently started a Mac focused blog at Ukmac.co.uk, even more coincidently James lived in Broseley a few miles away from Ironbridge in the opposite direction from myself. It was meant to be I guess.\nSuffice to say James, Will and myself ended up meeting in Ironbridge for a few beers and to talk about our favourite subject, Macs.\nWill was one of life\u0026rsquo;s characters. If you ever heard any of his podcast episodes you will know what I mean. His blog and podcast were unique and eccentric, there really weren\u0026rsquo;t any like it at the time (nor since that I have seen at least). In addition to his irregular podcast postings Will used to host a Christmas get together in Ironbridge and would invite any of his listeners who wished to meet up for drinks and a curry at his local Indian restaurant, the Aftab.\nOn a couple of these meet-ups Will got us together at a little studio he had at the time to record a podcast episode before we headed to town for food. The resulting recordings were somewhat less than polished but that wasn\u0026rsquo;t the point and didn\u0026rsquo;t stop everyone enjoying being part of the process.\nWill\u0026rsquo;s funeral was this Tuesday in Shrewsbury and I was fully intending to go to show my respects and also to meet-up with some of the group that used to go to Will\u0026rsquo;s Christmas events but in a cruel twist I have been laid up in bed all week with a viral illness and was not able to make it.\n","date":"2023-08-05T00:00:00Z","image":"https://ukmac.net/p/will-green/britishmac_hu6661ddf96582d480c15ba621d7db0159_16233_120x120_fill_q75_box_smart1.jpg","permalink":"https://ukmac.net/p/will-green/","title":"Will Green - BritishMac"},{"content":"14 Peaks: Nothing is Impossible is a fascinating documentary about a group of Nepalese mountaineers led by the fearless Nirmal Purja who set out to conquer all 14 of the worlds 8,000+ metre mountains in under 7 months.\nA staggering watch, well recommended.

I have spent most of it lay in bed, coughing and feeling weak and exhausted. My chest hurts and my head feels like its full of cotton wool and I am actually really tired of feeling this way. It\u0026rsquo;s only a week, nothing compared to what some people have to endure.\nA lot of this week I haven\u0026rsquo;t felt up to doing much at all, I have watched a couple of films which is a bit of a first, I hadn\u0026rsquo;t watched a full film for a long time either. The rest of the time I have been trying to avoid looking at my work inbox/Teams because I know that I would (and did on Tuesday) get drawn into it and hours would quickly pass before I realised that I wasn\u0026rsquo;t doing as I have been told and resting but instead would have been getting stressed about the build up of \u0026ldquo;stuff\u0026rdquo; that I am going to have to deal with when I return to work.\nThis has left the remaining time to browse news sites and lurk on Mastodon, both activities that don\u0026rsquo;t do much to cheer you up. Doom, gloom and bad news\u0026hellip; Just now I ended on a link to a YouTube video by Cal Newport titled The Perks of Living Without Social Media. In it Cal explains how he has never had social media accounts and the various benefits of living without social media (conveniently side stepping the fact that as a YouTuber he is very much using social media for his job, but we will let that one slide for now). It did make me think though and I realised although I haven\u0026rsquo;t got a Facebook account and deleted my Twitter account after Elon took that service down the toilet I still spend a lot of my time reading what others have to say either on news sites, Mastodon or YouTube. And its true there is a lot there that its better not to know or at least better not to let get into your head and affect your mood and how you think about things.\nI guess there is a fine balance between keeping informed and letting the enormous deluge of information available to us all become overwhelming.\nWhat I also realised this week is that when I am not working or thinking about work I don\u0026rsquo;t really have an interest or passion that I can spend my spare time on to help me to avoid doom scrolling.

Having worked predominantly with an external mouse and keyboard with my MacBook in clamshell mode in a vertical stand I decided I would like to disable the MacBook trackpad.\nSimple you would think? Apple do kindly offer a setting in the Mouse \u0026amp; Trackpad Accessibility preferences to do this very thing, however after switching on the option I found my trackpad was still fully operation even with my Logitech MX Master connected. It appears that Bluetooth mice don\u0026rsquo;t register as a mouse being present?\nThe fix I discovered was to use another Accessibility preference known as Mouse Keys, a legacy service designed to allow cursor control using the keyboard.\nFirstly enable Mouse Keys by switching on the slider in the Pointer Control options, then click on the i next to the slider to reveal the additional preferences dialog below.\nSwitch on the two sliders to disable the trackpad when Mouse Keys is on and also enable the option to quickly enable/disable Mouse Keys by pressing the Option key 5 times. You should find that the trackpad is now correctly disabled. To enable the trackpad again just turn off Mouse Keys by tapping Option key 5 times.\nJob done.\n","date":"2023-03-06T00:00:00Z","permalink":"https://ukmac.net/p/managing-trackpad-on-macos-when-using-external-mouse/","title":"Managing Trackpad on MacOS when using external mouse"},{"content":"Turned out nicely I think.\n","date":"2023-03-05T00:00:00Z","permalink":"https://ukmac.net/p/new-desk-layout/","title":"New Desk layout"},{"content":"Six months into the new job and things are starting to get pretty busy and I am certainly past the honeymoon period and into the time when people around the organisation know who I am.

With the upgrade to iOS 16/macOS Ventura bringing Continuity Camera support I have been using my iPhone as a replacement for the MacBook webcam and I have to say it works remarkably well, I have had no glitches/disconnects during use with Teams calls in many short and long meetings. My main issue has been finding a way to attach the iPhone at the top of the screen so I appear to be looking in the right direction. I have a fairly dodgy setup at the moment as I haven\u0026rsquo;t found the ideal tool to do this. I have attached a small L bracket to the VESA mounting on the back of the monitor and am then using a small tripod clamp around the iPhone to give it the necessary width and height to raise the camera above the top of the monitor. It works but is not ideal and I will have to try to rig something a bit more substantial in the New Year. There is definitely a market for a nice solution here, most of the stuff available is designed for MagSafe connectors ( my iPhone 11 doesn\u0026rsquo;t have MagSafe ) and for attachment by sticky pads.\nIf anyone has a good solution for this I would love to hear from you.\nDaily Links Link Description Continuity Camera Apple guide on using Continutiy Camera My Mastodon Profile Try TWiT.social for a friendly and tech centered Mastodon instance ","date":"2022-12-23T00:00:00Z","image":"https://ukmac.net/p/pre-xmas-post/continuity-camera_hu934ce72ddf01e272c95cc3fc24b17973_35598_120x120_fill_q75_box_smart1.jpg","permalink":"https://ukmac.net/p/pre-xmas-post/","title":"Pre-Xmas Post"},{"content":"Today finds me at home still full of cold after more than a week with a beautiful sunny day outside that would have been perfect for an Autumn bike ride.

After years of using laptop keyboards, the Logitech K380 and the Apple Magic Keyboard the K3 takes some getting used to. The keys have of course got more travel and sit higher than the other keyboards I am used to.\nWhilst I\u0026rsquo;m not a proper touch typist but can normally achieve a reasonable number of characters per minute but with the K3 I am still finding myself making quite a lot of typos. To be honest when I first got the keyboard I was making so many errors that I temporarily went back to my Apple Magic Keyboard. Since then I have been trying to get along with the K3 again, partly because I dont want to admit defeat and partly because I think once I am used to it I will find it a better keyboard than the Magic Keyboard. From a practical point of view the other thing I have been a little disappointed with is the battery life and the bluetooth connection speed. Battery life is I guess to be expected due to the backlight which you can of course turn off to improve things but at the expense of one of the nice features of the K3.\nThe Bluetooth connection is not as easy to address however. The issue I have here is that when the keyboard goes to sleep to conserve battery the bluetooth connection to my MacBook obviously drops which is to be expected, however when hitting a key for the first time after this happens (when returning to typing after a short break for example) the bluetooth connection does not immediately reestablish and the first few keystrokes are lost. This is frustrating and because of this I have taken to connecting via USB C cable which doesnt suffer from this issue but of course means I now have a cable running from my nice wireless keyboard..\nI am planning to keep trying the K3 for a bit longer yet but in the worst case I can always box it up and post an ad on eBay, I\u0026rsquo;m sure it will sell easily enough.\nLinks Link Description Keychron K3 Hot swappable low profile wireless mechanical keyboard Logitech K380 Affordable multi device compact wireless keyboard Apple Magic Keyboard Apple compact wireless keyboard ","date":"2022-08-21T00:00:00Z","image":"https://ukmac.net/p/my-experiences-with-the-keychron-k3-wireless-keyboard/keychron_hu1b04cfdc90f31c9e2c8e0c0488b3c8af_56552_120x120_fill_q75_box_smart1.jpg","permalink":"https://ukmac.net/p/my-experiences-with-the-keychron-k3-wireless-keyboard/","title":"My Experiences with the Keychron K3 Wireless Keyboard"},{"content":"Katie Kookaburra Katie is a long distance specialist who loves to climb hills.

Yesterday I switched on a Malware Policy to block certain files types after reading this article. All seemed fine but then first thing this morning I received a number of calls from users unable to email Helpdesk calls to our Helpdesk system (Freshdesk). It seems as though the change I made yesterday had triggered a mail rule setup to block users autoforwarding emails externally into action that must not have been working before.\nTo log calls with Freshdesk by email you send to a specific email address that is created when Freshdesk is configured. To make things easy for my organisations users I had setup a shared mailbox with the email address support@xxxx and instructed them to log calls by emailing this address. The shared mailbox was then set to autoforward to the Freshdesk email address. This autoforward was now broken and so users were unable to log calls or reply to existing ones.\nUnfortunately trying to fix mail rules in Exchange is made more difficult due to the very long time it takes for changes made to become operational. According to Lance Cal in this Microsoft Community thread changes can take up to 12 hours to become active. Thats a whole working day before I can see if the change I made to fix our issue works and during which time our IT Helpdesk that relies on email autoforward rules to operate remains unusable.\nUpdate It seems that Exchange mail rules is not what I should have been looking at after all. What I discovered was that the mail rule I thought was blocking the autoforward was not being triggered at all. I found this by running the mail rule report ( shown highlighted in red in diagram below )\nOnce I could see that no emails were matching the rule I started looking for other places where autoforwarding might be blocked. I had suspected there was probably something in the 365 Security and Compliance site that was responsible and the obvious culprit was in the Anti-Spam settings. What I found here was that the \u0026ldquo;Automatic forwarding\u0026rdquo; setting was set to \u0026ldquo;Automatic - System-controlled\u0026rdquo;. Changing this to \u0026ldquo;On - Forwarding is enabled\u0026rdquo; immediately resolved the issue I was having but of course at the same time changed the default policy for all users to allow auto-forwarding externally.\nTo fix this I needed to add a new Outbound policy that blocked all users from autoforwarding but excluded the Helpdesk shared mailbox. The rule below does this and the best part is changes are effective immediately so no waiting for 12 hours for mail rules to take effect.\nA long day but hopefully one where I learned something about the way that mail policies work.\n","date":"2020-12-08T00:00:00Z","permalink":"https://ukmac.net/p/daily-post-08/12/2020/","title":"Daily Post - 08/12/2020"},{"content":"MacBook Air Update Loving the new MacBook.

Then I came across this video from GPLama in which he explains how to use a third party web site called Zwifthub to keep track of all your Zwift badges and achievements. You can setup a Zwifthub account or login with a Google account (unfortunately there is no direct link to your Zwift account) and manually update your profile with all your achievements to date. After that you can use the simple filters in the web site sidebar to show you which routes you have completed, which are still to be done, which are available to ride today and then further sort the lists by distance, elevation, gradient etc.\nThe site is simple in focus but very well executed and fills the gap left by Zwift extremely well.

The video was produced by Liberty a Human Rights Group to highlight to the public the potential far reaching consequences if the so called \u0026ldquo;Snoopers Charter\u0026rdquo; is passed.\nThe video is shown below along with the press release from Liberty that explains in more detail what the group is doing to raise awareness of this critically important issue. Please share this video widely. Thank you.\nLIBERTY LAUNCHES FILM TO BRING HOME TRUE SCALE OF NEW SNOOPERS’ CHARTER Human rights group Liberty has today launched a short film highlighting the unprecedented, unnecessary and deeply intrusive spying powers handed to hundreds of public bodies by the latest incarnation of the Snoopers’ Charter.\nThe video created by Liberty and creative agency Don’t Panic, sees comedian Olivia Lee take to the streets demanding a look at strangers’ most personal and sensitive information – the same information to which a broad range of public bodies will gain unfettered access if the Investigatory Powers Bill becomes law.\nThe team who brought you ‘The Revolution Will Be Televised’ got together again to bring you ‘Show me yours\u0026hellip;.’. Joe Wade, MD at Don’t Panic notes: “We used hidden cameras to pick up people’s reaction caused by Olivia’s invasive baiting which highlights that people do and should care about their privacy. The use of hidden cameras was to reflect the very nature of how the government plans to pass this bill, hidden from the public and to convey a sense of unwarranted invasiveness that will come with the Snoopers’ Charter.”\nLiberty is calling on the public to sign up to its No #SnoopersCharter campaign and urge their MPs to reject the Bill when they vote on it this summer. This is one of the most intrusive and least accountable surveillance regimes in the world. There is a consensus from service providers, tech experts and three cross-party parliamentary committees that its plans are unclear, unworkable and potentially unlawful.\nThe Bill, currently being rushed through Parliament, will force telecoms companies to store everybody’s communications data for an entire year, this includes every site we visit, every communication programme and app we use, every system update we download and details of any device we use to go online (at huge cost to the public purse).\nThe Bill would also legalise:\nMass hacking of phones and other devices by the intelligence agencies, capable of dangerously undermining Britain’s digital infrastructure. Bulk interception of calls, emails, online exchanges and texts. Acquiring vast databases containing personal information on millions of people – potentially the whole population. Powers to force telecoms operators here and abroad, from Gmail, Facebook and Twitter to offices, businesses and law firms, to remove encryption – and ban them from revealing they have been forced to do so. CALL TO ACTION: Please watch and share this video to encourage people to join the and help protect our human rights.\nFor campaign page: http://www.nosnooperscharter.org.uk\nVideo link: https://youtu.be/szN7DlmMLYg\nHashtag: #snooperscharter\nQuotes from team: Bella Sankey, Policy Director for Liberty, said: “As this film shows, people in Britain value their personal privacy – even Home Office staff are unwilling to reveal their phone records for no good reason. But the Government’s latest Snoopers’ Charter would make everyone’s online activity available to the authorities to speculatively trawl through without good reason and without us ever being told.It will all but end online privacy, put our personal security at risk and swamp law enforcement with swathes of useless information. People need to make it clear to MPs – we don’t want the Government building profiles of our personal lives with no justification and this Bill must stopped.”\nJoe Wade, MD, Don’t Panic: “We are delighted to have worked with Liberty to make this video. Many people are complaisant about the surveillance bill, and so we wanted to highlight how invasive it will be! For this video we used a political satire format that has hugely successful for other videos we have created. Our aim was to create something that would tackle this challenging and very relevant subject in an honest way. Our team worked very closely with Liberty throughout the process; from establishing the initial hidden camera concept to developing the tone/messaging, to filming and the final delivery.”\nThanks,\nJon\n","date":"2016-05-06T00:00:00Z","permalink":"https://ukmac.net/p/show-me-yours/","title":"Show Me Yours"},{"content":" Enjoy\u0026hellip;\n","date":"2016-04-28T00:00:00Z","permalink":"https://ukmac.net/p/cassetteboy-vs-jeremy-hunt/","title":"CassetteBoy vs Jeremy Hunt"},{"content":"The rise in the prevelance of Ransomware hasn\u0026rsquo;t really impacted on Mac Users as it has with the Windows community so far\u0026hellip; Of course the Mac has benefited from a secure design and being a smaller (relatively) target over the years, but with the growth in use of OS X and the maturity of the tools used by unscrupulous elements this security by obscurity can no longer be guaranteed.\nWhen the official downloadable version of the popular BitTorrent client, Transmission, was infected with a Ransomware client ( KeRanger) in March year it seemed that the reality had come home to roost. The fact is Ransomware poses one of the biggest risks to everyones personal data so it is exciting to hear of a company who are trying to tackle the issue with a form of early detection and blocking for this type of computer virus.\nObjective-see is a company created by Patrick Wardle to publish security tools to protect Mac users and one of his products recently released, RansomWhere?, aims to mitigate the impact of a Ransomware infection. It does this by monitoring for activity that looks like Ransomware, notably the rapid modification of multiple files. When it detects suspicious access it identifies and stops the process responsible and prompts the user to warn them that there is a potential ongoing infection. It then offers the option of killing the process or if the alert is a false positive triggered by some known bulk update process for example, to ignore it.\nThis approach is not infallible and of course there may still be a small number of files encrypted before it detects what is going on but if it prevents hundreds or thousands of documents from being irretrievably encrypted (without handing over cash to the Ransomware creators) it is certainly better than nothing, especially when you consider that this is not a pay monthly service or even a pay-for app but is in fact free to download. It should be noted that this is not a fully developed solution and is more of a working proof of concept so you may chose to wait for future more stable version arrives.\nPatrick\u0026rsquo;s site goes into quite a bit of detail which might put off less technical users and I wonder if this program works well whether it should be launched in a more user friendly package ? It\u0026rsquo;s great to know the detail behind a solution such as this but most users are not that interested, they just need to know what it does and how to install. The low level information can be presented in technical specification page or a blog post. Speaking of which Patrick has a really interesting article on his site titled \u0026lsquo;Towards Generic Ransomware Detection?\u0026rsquo; that is worth a read.\nI have bookmarked Objective-see and will be watching this project with interest.\n","date":"2016-04-23T00:00:00Z","permalink":"https://ukmac.net/p/an-alternative-approach-to-preventing-ransomware/","title":"An Alternative Approach to Preventing Ransomware ?"},{"content":"My normal approach when a new version of OS X is released is to backup ( create a Carbon Copy Cloner image of my main drive ) and then do a clean install ( erase the entire drive and install from scratch ). Obviously this takes a little more time and effort than a normal upgrade but I tend to prefer knowing that any legacy cruft built up over the life of the previous version is washed away.\nWhen El Capitan was released last year I decided not to bother with a clean install on my MacBook and ran an upgrade and everything has worked fine since then until the last week or so. Firstly disk space has been getting low on my 256GB drive which is never great but then I started to experience a problem with the App Store taking a long time to load which deteriorated to the point where no matter how long I left it running the content in the main panes failed to materialise at all. As I wanted to load a particular new app this was a bit of a problem to say the least. I looked for solutions to the issue without much success ( admittedly I didn\u0026rsquo;t look that hard ) before deciding to do a re-install to freshen up my OS.\nRoll forward a couple of hours and I have a clean install of El Capitan, my essential data restored from backup, apps reinstalled and App Store fully working. I also now have 140GB of my 256GB drive still free which shows how much disk space can get swallowed up by working files and general detritus in the course of a year. Granted there are a few things I have chosen not to restore but nothing that would account for 100GB of disk space.\nAnyway, all this brings me to the point of this article which is how to enable three finger drag of windows in El Capitan ! When the re-install had finished one of the first things I did was to go to System Preferences to sort out my Trackpad settings. By default my three main tweaks to the standard configuration are to switch off natural scrolling ( I know old habits die hard ), switch on tap to click and finally switch on the option to drag windows with three finger gesture.\nThis time around the first two options were setup as normal but when I looked for the three finger drag option it seemed to have been moved. I was sure it used to be on the Scroll and Zoom section of the preference pane, or was it under More Gestures ? Nope, not there\u0026hellip; I must admit I looked for an embarrassingly long time going from one tab to the next in the vain hope that somehow I would see it where I hadn\u0026rsquo;t before, but it was gone\u0026hellip;\nThankfully it only took a minutes Googling to uncover the answer to the missing setting, Apple in their infinite wisdom have decided in El Capitan that this is not a Trackpad setting now but an Accessibility option ! To find the setting now first go to Accessibility in System Preferences, click on Trackpad Options and on the popup window tick to Enable dragging and select three finger drag from the drop down menu.\nOf course the other thing I should have done was to just type \u0026ldquo;three finger drag\u0026rdquo; into the search field in System Preferences which would have instantly told me I was looking in the wrong place !\n[gallery ids=\u0026ldquo;479,480,481\u0026rdquo; type=\u0026ldquo;slideshow\u0026rdquo;]\n","date":"2016-04-23T00:00:00Z","permalink":"https://ukmac.net/p/upgrading-os-x-issues/","title":"Upgrading OS X issues"},{"content":"Monosnap is a free utility for OS X and Windows that can quickly and easily capture screenshots and save them for editing and annotation, ideal for grabbing images for documentation or publishing to social media streams.\nThe included editing tools are basic but adequate with the usual circles, rectangles, crop, line capability but also and importantly for screen capture a blur tool for obscuring passwords or other areas with sensitive information.\nExample Screenshot showing editing tools\nUnlike most of the apps of this type though Monosnap has a power feature for bloggers and potential YouTubers, the ability to record a video of the screen including a lower thirds capture of your webcam to add narration with video to give your video tutorials a personal touch.

Most of the words have understandably been pretty negative with users feeling that the change is purely a money grab by Smile. Obviously the economics of making a niche product like TextExpander pay its way are not simple and I really don\u0026rsquo;t know if the change was actually an unavoidable option, but regardless of the reasons behind the decision it is fairly clear that a fair number of Smiles previous customers will be thinking twice about the upgrade and looking at alternative options.\nThere are a few alternatives to TextExpander and one of the main ones, Typinator from Ergonis are offering a discount to existing TextExpander users to move to their product during April.\nThe app is normally EUR 24.99 for a single user or EUR 37.99 for a family pack so the reduction makes it EUR 18.75 and EUR 28.50 respectively. To access the offer go to this link before the end of the month.\nIf you are not happy spending this much on an alternative then a cheaper option is aText at just $4.99.###UPDATE:\nSo it seems that the reasoning that Smile have given for the decision is based on the sharing features added in the updated version of TextExpander. They state on this page that the iCloud/Dropbox services would not allow them to implement the Group Sharing features that are the key new element of TextExpander.\nGroup sharing in the new TextExpander is quite different than syncing via Dropbox or iCloud.

It is a slick and useful clipboard manager that makes cut/copy and paste on iPhone,iPad and Mac much more useful and when combined with multiple devices introduces a new capability that was previously only possible by emailing or Messaging between devices. That feature is the ability to copy something on one device then jump over to another and paste that data on another device !\nThe iOS version has a free to use version that allows you to save up to 10 entries into the clipboard and to recall any of these to paste into another app. The entries can be free text, images and links and importantly can be edited after being captured into the clipboard.\nIn Use on iOS Pasting an existing entry from the clipboard can be done in a number of ways. Firstly you can load the app and scroll through the list of entries to find the one you want. Once located tap on the entry and it opens in an editor where ( if the entry is text ) you can edit the contents of the clipboard if required. From here you also have a standard iOS Share button which allows you to send the entry to a suitable app as a new item ( document/tweet/Message etc ).\nAlternatively you can click on the three dots icon to either copy the entry into the current clipboard ( so you can paste it into another app/document ), Share using a template or Transform the text if applicable. Transforming text gives options to convert to upper/lower/title case, removing whitespace etc.\nCopied Keyboard The other method for accessing clipboard entries is through the Copied keyboard. This is accessed in the same way as other third party iOS keyboards by tapping the globe key on the standard keyboard to cycle through any additional keyboards you have installed. The keyboard replaces the normal keys with a grid of clipboard entries which you can scroll through ( sideways ) to find the entry you wish to paste into your document or text. Just tap the entry to paste the data at the cursor. Simple.\nCopied+ For a small in-app purchase ( £1.49 in UK ) the basic free version can be upgraded to Copied+ which increases the clipboard size to 1,000 items and also includes the ability to organise clippings into Lists for better organisation. For example I have is a list of clippings for my address, mobile phone number etc which I can then use to quickly enter these into web forms. Copied+ also enables iCloud sync of the clipboard between devices as mentioned at the beginning of this review.\nCopied for Mac The synchronisation doesn\u0026rsquo;t end with iOS though, when used in conjunction with the OS X version of the app data can be easily transferred between Mac and iPhone/iPad in just the same way. This is an incredibly useful feature and one that would really fit into the core operating system on these devices if Apple ever saw fit to develop this, however for now Copied fills this space very nicely. It should be said that the OS X version of the app is £5.99 which isn\u0026rsquo;t free and there are other apps that provide similar features, but in my experience using Copied is a smooth and effective way of improving the way in which I can transfer data between apps on my iPhone and also between iPhone and Mac and I believe the overall benefit is worth the small outlay.\nCopied for iOS\nCopied for OS X\nCopied Web Site\n","date":"2016-04-06T00:00:00Z","permalink":"https://ukmac.net/p/copied-app-for-ios-and-os-x/","title":"Copied app for iOS and OS X"},{"content":"The Pixo is an interesting looking Kickstarter project to create a magnetic mounting for iPads/tablets to attach to the side or top of your desktop screen/iMac.\nCurrently they are quite a way off reaching their target of £60,000 but it still has some time to go and may still be able to get funded.

Once installed and configured the app can be configured to lock or unlock your Mac as soon as it detects the presence of your iPhone. The sensitivity of the detection can be adjusted from as little as 1m to as much as 10m so you can optimise the point at which it locks or unlocks your Mac according to your requirements.\nThe app works with recent iPhones and Macs that support Bluetooth LE and as a result can be left switched on all the time without it causing a significant drain on iPhone batteries. Furthermore the currently free in app upgrade to the Pro version on iOS allows the app to work even when in the background so there is no need to unlock your iPhone or run an app to unlock your Mac. If you are worried that just being able to walk up to your Mac with your iPhone is a little insecure ( think someone gets your phone and can unlock and access your Mac ) then the iOS app can be setup to require Touch ID authentication before it will unlock which is a nice but still convenient way of accessing your Mac.\nWonderful stuff\u0026hellip; Get it now while it is free !\nWeb Site : Near Lock\n","date":"2016-04-06T00:00:00Z","permalink":"https://ukmac.net/p/near-lock/","title":"Near Lock"},{"content":"One of my favourite quick-fix games at the moment is 2 Cars from Ketchapp. It is a very simple top to bottom scroller where the objective is to steer your 2 Cars around the oncoming square blocks whilst at the same time intercepting the round blocks. Any collision with a square block ends the game. Any round block missed also ends the game. Each car can drive in one of two lanes and the only control is to tap the screen on the right to move the right hand car to the alternate lane and the screen on the left to move the left hand car.\nSounds simple doesn\u0026rsquo;t it ? Well give it a try and see how far you get, I can pretty much guarantee it will take you quite a few goes before you progress to double digit scores and after that progression is likely to be slow as the speed of the oncoming blocks increases pretty quickly once you get into the 40-50 score bracket.\nAn enjoyable game for passing a few minutes !\n","date":"2016-04-04T00:00:00Z","permalink":"https://ukmac.net/p/game-of-the-day-2-cars/","title":"Game of the day - 2 Cars"},{"content":"I recently bought the excellent Logitech K380 Multi-Device Bluetooth Keyboard to share between my iPad, Work laptop and iPhone.

They are relatively cheap and can be used with whatever size of MicroSD card you have available. The downside is that the disk space provided is a separate volume to the internal drive and as such you have to manage which files and folders go where. It is certainly a neater solution than plugging a USB drive into your MacBook but if the internal drive is struggling for space it doesn\u0026rsquo;t immediately solve that issue.\nThen last night I came across a product called TarDisk Pear which uses the same idea of plugging extra storage into the SD card slot in a completely flush carrier but extends it to the next level. With the TarDisk Pear instead of the extra disk space being presented as an external removable volume the additional storage is magically used to extend the space available to the internal drive ! The web site doesn\u0026rsquo;t give many details on exactly how it does this but there are a few hints on the FAQ\u0026rsquo;s page where it talks about the risk of data corruption and loss if you remove the drive after it has been setup. Clearly the magic comes at a price.\nDespite looking I couldn\u0026rsquo;t find any information about the impact on the performance of the built in drive either. I would hope that it manages the data in a way that optimises the performance of the internal drive but this isn\u0026rsquo;t clear from what I have seen.\nPricing starts at $149 for 128GB rising to £399 for 256GB.\n","date":"2016-02-15T00:00:00Z","permalink":"https://ukmac.net/p/tardisk-pear/","title":"TarDisk Pear"},{"content":"Itsycal is a tiny menu bar application for OS X that gives rapid access to a pop up view of the current month of the calendar.\nJust click the menu bar icon (the current date by default) and a compact view of the current month is displayed.

Adding cards is very quick, just search for the store name from the extensive list then scan the card bar code using the iPhone camera and the cards details are captured. Now you can present the bar code on your iPhone to the cashier when making a purchase and they can scan this instead of the plastic. The app can also store card details for shops/companies not listed including adding a photo of the card for easy reference. I have used it to import my library cards for example.\nStocard do acknowledge that some older scanners aren\u0026rsquo;t able to read the iPhone screen but in these cases the bar code can be entered manually by the cashier.\nThe app is available for iOS and Android and is a free download.\n","date":"2016-01-18T00:00:00Z","permalink":"https://ukmac.net/p/stocard-for-ios/","title":"Stocard for iOS"},{"content":"Duet Display is a slick app developed by ex-Apple employees designed to allow your iPad to function as a second monitor on your laptop or iMac using a lightning or iPad 30 pin cable ( for older iPads ). The application works extremely well with none of the lag or latency in display refresh experienced by some of the alternative apps that use the iPads WiFi connection to transfer screen updates.\nAs the Duet name suggests the intended use for the app is to create an easy to use portable secondary display for MacBook users ( or in fact Windows laptop users as there is a Windows version of the server application as well as one for OS X ) but it isn\u0026rsquo;t limited to this use case. My main use of Duet is as a primary monitor on my Mac Mini media server.\nI have used my Mac Mini in a headless ( no monitor ) setup for a long time and use Screen Sharing from my MacBook to login and manage it, however it recently struck me that the Duet Display appthat I had purchased some time ago would be perfect for creating a tiny compact keyboard/monitor setup.

For people who travel with a MacBook and iPad the benefit of being able to setup a usable dual monitor setup whilst on the move can be liberating, and for home media servers like mine it can create a slick, compact and usable alternative to a bulky VGA/HDMI monitor.\n","date":"2016-01-03T00:00:00Z","permalink":"https://ukmac.net/p/using-duet-display-as-a-primary-monitor/","title":"Using Duet Display As A Primary Monitor"},{"content":"One of the big missing features of the new Apple TV was the inability to play music from Apple Music using Siri.

Since the early days of podcasting there has been a rapid growth in the number of podcast networks and shows within those networks which is great to a point. The problem comes in deciding which ones are worthy of attention and how to sample new ones whilst at the same time keeping up with the regulars.\nMany of the shows I listen to average around 2 hours per episode which for me is a whole days commuting ( 1 hour in each direction ). With only 4-5 working days drives a week ( I work at home on average once a week ) it doesn\u0026rsquo;t leave much room for new podcasts to find their way onto my playlist, especially as I tend to also have an Audible title on the go most of the time as well. The result of this is that I tend to continue to listen to mostly the same content and only occasionally change or add new podcasts to my player.\nMy current playlist looks something like this :\n[table id=2 /]\nIn addition to the regulars above I have a small list of irregular shows that I sample when I feel like it, mostly from the same podcast networks as the list above but with the odd variant thrown in for good measure. One that I dropped on a while ago that turned out to be so gripping that my regular playlist went out of the window until I had finished it was the Serial Podcast. This is a fascinating series of 10 episodes following a murder that happened in Baltimore in 1999 hosted by Sarah Koenig and was a spin off of This American Life. Not my normal techie faire but I really enjoyed this one and am actually looking forward to the forthcoming follow up series.\nI suppose like Seth I have to accept that the reality is that I will never be able to listen to all the content that I might want to, there is simply too much to handle. It is also good news for anyone who has not yet ventured away from broadcast radio into the world of podcasts, believe me once you start you will continue and will probably not bother with commercial FM/DAB radio again !\nUPDATE : Will Green ( BritishMac ) is back !

Perhaps it was a bunch of irretrievable photos lost when your hard drive suddenly and inexplicably died ? Or maybe it was your lifetimes collection of music or movies, carefully downloaded and collated onto that 4TB external hard drive connected to your desktop computer that you hadn\u0026rsquo;t noticed had been accidentally deleted ?\nWhichever it was, when the day arrives and you suffer that unrecoverable data loss the chances are you will be asking yourself why you hadn\u0026rsquo;t taken the time to backup to another disk.\nMy preferred and recommended backup solution is an online service called Backblaze. Backblaze is cheap ( as little as $5 a month ), reliable and easy to setup and better yet, once configured you can forget it is there and relax in the knowledge that should the worst happen your data is safe and easily retrieved.\nUnlike most Internet file storage solutions ( Dropbox, OneDrive etc ) the cost for Backblaze is the same whether you are backing up 100MB or 20TB ! The only difference will be the amount of time it takes to complete the initial backup, something that is getting easier as home broadband speeds steadily increase. This initial \u0026ldquo;seeding\u0026rdquo; of your backup may take some weeks to complete but it happens in the background and is carefully controlled by the Backblaze software to not interfere with your Internet access too much. Once the first backup is complete the software then only has to update the backup when anything changes to your local data, again a process that happens in the background without manual intervention.\nBackblaze will backup any of your hard drives, not just the internal drive in your PC or Mac. Just plugin your external USB drives, configure the application settings and wait for the data to be secured. One thing to note here though is that if you do this Backblaze needs to \u0026ldquo;see\u0026rdquo; that drive at least once every 30 days or it will assume the data does not need to be retained and will delete it.\nObviously paying for backup services is not sexy, it doesn\u0026rsquo;t really give you anything other than piece of mind, but it is something that everyone who has any amount of data in digital form should consider putting in place.\nIf you would like to try out Backblaze you can sign up for a months free trial by clicking on this link.\nThis post is not sponsored by Backblaze it is purely my personal choice of backup service and something that I recommend to friends and relatives when the subject arises.

It was during my familiarisation with the library services on their web site that I came across this page ! Basically library members can register for FREE to access a range of magazines through the popular service Zinio.com.

So glad I didn\u0026rsquo;t now as the Nat Geo is one of the magazines available through the Telford library service for free.\nAll that is needed to take advantage of the deal is a library membership card ( available for free to local residents ). Once you are a member you can register through the link on the library web site which gives you access to select from the range of magazines that the library make available ( currently 31 titles at Telford ) and download to your tablet/desktop Zinio reader app or to read online through the Zinio web site.\nSince signing up for this service I have spoken with a variety of friends and work colleagues and told them how I can access magazines online for free. When we have looked at the services available from their local libraries ( Birmingham, Wolverhampton, Walsall etc ) we have discovered that they also offer the same sort of service. In fact most of them have a wider range of magazine titles available than my library in Telford !\nIf you would like to subscribe to this service head over to your local library web site and do a search for Zinio, I am betting that you will find there is a free service available to you that you didn\u0026rsquo;t know was there !\nEnjoy, ","date":"2015-06-24T00:00:00Z","permalink":"https://ukmac.net/p/how-to-access-magazines-on-zinio-for-free/","title":"How to Access Magazines on Zinio for Free"},{"content":"I just happened across this tidbit and though its not really Mac or Apple related I thought it was worth posting a quick note about it because I expect many people in the UK may not be aware of the forthcoming changes to telephone call charges that come into force on 1st July 2015.\nAll the information you need can be found at http://ukcalling.info.

The resulting stream of hilarious mickey takes quickly spread and was widely reported.\nIf you want to avoid becoming the subject of world wide ridicule like Sid you might be advised to check out this article from Lifehack.org which was put together to help travellers to make the most of their photo opportunities and nab those funny pics first time, without the use of photo editing tools ( or Reddit ! )\n","date":"2015-06-16T00:00:00Z","permalink":"https://ukmac.net/p/how-to-take-funny-travel-photos-the-right-way/","title":"How to Take Funny Travel Photos - The Right Way"},{"content":"ImageOptim is a small free utility for Mac OS X that does one thing well. It compresses image files but without reducing image quality. On test files I have found that compression rates vary between a few percent up to over 50% and the resulting images look exactly the same.\nImageOptim is only available through the developers web site and NOT the App Store (although the author does note that copies have been sold through the app store so buyer beware).\nIf you are looking for a quick convenient app to reduce image file sizes without sacrificing original image quality ImageOptim is a recommended download.\n","date":"2015-05-11T00:00:00Z","permalink":"https://ukmac.net/p/imageoptim/","title":"ImageOptim"},{"content":"\nIt\u0026rsquo;s hard to imagine Apple producing anything quite like these now, but apparently according to this article on HUH thats exactly what they did back in 1986.

But what if the pre-installed templates aren’t quite what you need for your current project or task ?\nThere are a surprisingly small number of sites where you can find additional templates for the iWork applications. The list below contains the best ones that seem to be available at the moment. If you know of any better ones please drop a comment on this post and I will gladly update it to include them.\niWorkCommunity.com:Template Exchange - This site is probably the most comprehensive currently available. At the time of writing there were 225 Pages templates, 5 for Keynote and 15 for Numbers. All the templates here are free to download and use.\niWork Templates - This is a slightly more recent free template site which currently only has about 18 templates to offer.\nNumber Templates - This site specialises on free templates for Numbers as well as providing hints and tips on how to use the application.\nJumsoft is a commercial site providing high quality templates for iWeb, Pages and Keynote as well as clipart and animations. The Pages templates product is $39 and provides a range of 20 different templates.\nKeynote Pro is another commercial site that offers a range of templates for Pages and of course Keynote. Their themes are exceptionally elegant and stylish.\nOneeyedgoldfish is a UK based company who provide a range of templates for Pages at £10 per theme or all of their themes for £40. They also have a small number of free templates for download as a taster of their full offerings.\nSo there you have it. A small list for now but hopefully of help anyway. Please do tell me of any other good resources for iWork by leaving a comment below.\n","date":"2008-05-04T00:00:00Z","permalink":"https://ukmac.net/p/iwork-resources-and-templates/","title":"iWork resources and templates"}]
