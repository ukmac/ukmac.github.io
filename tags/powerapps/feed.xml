Wish connection to Exchange Online and Sharepoint Online from Powershell was a little easier to configure.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Interestingly when I tried this today if I ran Connect-EXOPSSesion with parameter for my UPN it didn&amp;rsquo;t seem to work. If instead just ran the command with no parameters the standard login dialog appeared fine and I could enter my email address and authenticate with my Authenticator app ! Odd one&amp;hellip;&lt;/p>

&lt;p>I definitely need to come back to this one ! One of the tips here is to enable permissions to Sharepoint lists for PowerApps. The bit I need for my current project is to enable row level permissions so that users can only see entries they created. Very useful tip..&lt;/p>

&lt;p>ARGHH !&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So I have created an app that uses the AzureAD connector to find the logged in users account details (Office location) only to find that when deploying this app to actual users ( who aren&amp;rsquo;t Azure AD admins ) it doesn&amp;rsquo;t work ! The user needs admin rights to query AzureAD so the connector is effectively no good for what I want to use it for.. Ah well.. Back to the Drawing board ! See article below for more.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>So I am making some progress with learning PowerApps and have the start of a new app for the charity to use. Just came across this resource which will be worth having a look through, a showcase for what others have done with PowerApps&lt;/p>
