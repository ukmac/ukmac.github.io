&lt;p>According to my Veloviewer account (which I had fogotten I had and noticed just now that it runs out in 3 days) this year was back to my 2019 levels which is to say the worst it has been for 4 years. Nothing I didn&amp;rsquo;t already know but it does show that I have been lax this year and need to make more of an effort in 2024.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Climbing on Zwift - La Laguna Negra</title><link>/p/climbing-on-zwift-la-laguna-negra/</link><pubDate>Sat, 16 Sep 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/p/climbing-on-zwift-la-laguna-negra/</guid><description>&lt;img src="/p/climbing-on-zwift-la-laguna-negra/la-laguna-negra.jpg" alt="Featured image of post Climbing on Zwift - La Laguna Negra" />&lt;p>This afternoons Zwift ride was a toughy&amp;hellip; At the start or the current Zwift Portal Climb for La Laguna Negra my estimated time to summit was hovering between 42 and 45 minutes. With that in mind I started spinning my way towards the top at a fairly consistent rate but with an eye on the segment details which showed the average gradient of the last segment as 10.1% !&lt;/p>
&lt;p>As I approached section 10 I was feeling a little less than fresh but still on track for a time of around 43 minutes but this last section really was tough. In my lowest gear and standing up on the pedals I was slowed to crawl but at this point being beaten was not an option.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Its fair to say I was very pleased to see the summit banner and the pool of sweat on the floor was a good indicator of how hard this climb was.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Glad to have another portal climb in the bank though.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Today was my first proper ride for over a couple of weeks and also my first go on the new [Zwift Portal(https://zwiftinsider.com/climb-portal-list/)] routes. I was prompted to try &lt;a class="link" href="https://zwiftinsider.com/portal/crow-road/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>Crow Rd&lt;/a> on the Zwift rides home screen so I decided I would give it a go. At 6.9km this is not a particularly long climb but after not riding for a while and with legs that still felt a little on the weak side it may have turned out to be a bad idea.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The route is 251m of elevation and the steppest parts of the route are thankfully in the first km so you can get those bits over early and then settle into a slightly easier average gradient for the next 4-5km.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Thankfully my lungs and legs held out and I made it to the top in what felt like a fairly respectable time of just under 26 mins. Now I have the first one under my belt I think I will aim to try and complete the other routes over the next few weeks.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>New Zwift Hub Smart Trainer Announced</title><link>/p/new-zwift-hub-smart-trainer-announced/</link><pubDate>Tue, 06 Sep 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/p/new-zwift-hub-smart-trainer-announced/</guid><description>&lt;img src="/p/new-zwift-hub-smart-trainer-announced/zwifthub.jpg" alt="Featured image of post New Zwift Hub Smart Trainer Announced" />&lt;p>&lt;a class="link" href="https://uk.zwift.com/pages/zwift-hub" target="_blank" rel="noopener"

&lt;p>At just over 22km its not a hard ride but it does include the fairly painful New York KOM that tops out at 17% right in the middle of it, so there is that ! Fairly sure I have ridden this route multiple times before as well though seemingly not to the end as I hadn&amp;rsquo;t got the achievement in the trophy cabinet but now I do.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Zwift Planning - Route Achievements</title><link>/p/zwift-planning-route-achievements/</link><pubDate>Tue, 04 Aug 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/p/zwift-planning-route-achievements/</guid><description>&lt;p>Over the last few weeks I have been working my way through the Zwift Achievements and so far have managed to complete 61% of the routes ( 46 out of 76 ), obviously not all in the last few weeks&amp;hellip;.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Until recently I hadn&amp;rsquo;t seen an easy way of tracking progress on Zwift without actually sitting on my bike, launching Zwift, starting a ride and then navigating to the achievements section. The Zwift companion app does a fairly poor job of showing you historical activity other than the chronological list of activities completed. Then I came across &lt;a class="link" href="https://youtu.be/KgSfajJzW6M" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>this video from GPLama&lt;/a> in which he explains how to use a third party web site called &lt;a class="link" href="https://zwifthub.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>Zwifthub&lt;/a> to keep track of all your Zwift badges and achievements. You can setup a Zwifthub account or login with a Google account (unfortunately there is no direct link to your Zwift account) and manually update your profile with all your achievements to date. After that you can use the simple filters in the web site sidebar to show you which routes you have completed, which are still to be done, which are available to ride today and then further sort the lists by distance, elevation, gradient etc.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The site is simple in focus but very well executed and fills the gap left by Zwift extremely well. I would imagine that many other Zwifters would find this service useful or at least interesting, even if they are not aiming to complete all the routes and badges on Zwift.&lt;/p>

>Zwift&lt;/a> for me. Finally after about 18 months of rides I passed the 50,000m climbing needed to be awarded the &lt;a class="link" href="https://zwiftinsider.com/tron-bike/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"

&lt;p>Prior to my ride yesterday I had around 800m of climb left to do so decided what better way to knock off those last metres than to do it on &lt;a class="link" href="https://zwiftinsider.com/massive-alpe-du-zwift-climb-released/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>Alpe du Zwift&lt;/a>. I was about 3/4 of the way up when the notification popped onto the screen to say I had been awarded the Tron bike. As you can see from the picture I took the opportunity when I got to the top to quickly change over to my new steed for the ride down again (with suitably large smile on my face!)&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Happy cyclist :)&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
